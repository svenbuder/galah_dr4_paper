	Abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

	Abstract = {For many researchers, Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. Several resources exist for individual pieces of this data science stack, but only with the Python Data Science Handbook do you get them all IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and other related tools. Working scientists and data crunchers familiar with reading and writing Python code will find this comprehensive desk reference ideal for tackling day-to-day issues: manipulating, transforming, and cleaning data; visualizing different types of data; and using data to build statistical or machine learning models. Quite simply, this is the must-have reference for scientific computing in Python. With this handbook, youll learn how to use:IPython and Jupyter: provide computational environments for data scientists using PythonNumPy: includes the ndarray for efficient storage and manipulation of dense data arrays in PythonPandas: features the DataFrame for efficient storage and manipulation of labeled/columnar data in PythonMatplotlib: includes capabilities for a flexible range of data visualizations in PythonScikit-Learn: for efficient and clean Python implementations of the most important and established machine learning algorithms},

	Abstract = {{We present a chemical abundance distribution study in 14 {$\alpha$}, odd-Z,
even-Z, light, and Fe-peak elements of approximately 3200
intermediate-metallicity giant stars from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. The main aim of our
analysis is to explore the Galactic disc-halo transition region within
-1.20 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.55 as a means to study chemical difference
(and similarities) between these components. In this paper, we show that
there is an {$\alpha$}-poor and {$\alpha$}-rich sequence within both the
metal-poor and intermediate-metallicity regions. Using the Galactic
rest-frame radial velocity and spatial positions, we further separate
our sample into the canonical Galactic components. We then studied the
abundances ratios of Mg, Ti, Si, Ca, O, S, Al, C+N, Na, Ni, Mn, V, and K
for each of the components and found the following: (1) the {$\alpha$}-poor
halo subgroup is chemically distinct in the {$\alpha$}-elements,
particularly O, Mg, S, Al, C+N, and Ni, from the {$\alpha$}-rich halo,
consistent with the literature confirming the existence of an
{$\alpha$}-poor accreted halo population; (2) the canonical thick disc and
halo are not chemically distinct in all elements indicating a smooth
transition between the thick disc and halo; (3) a subsample of the
{$\alpha$}-poor stars at metallicities as low as [Fe/H] {\tilde} -0.85 dex
are chemically and dynamically consistent with the thin disc indicating
that the thin disc may extend to lower metallicities than previously
thought; and (4) the locations of the most metal-poor thin disc stars
are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient. Finally, we
used our analysis to suggest a new set of chemical abundance planes
([{$\alpha$}/Fe], [C+N/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Mg/Mn]) that may be able to
chemically label the Galactic components in a clean and efficient way
independent of kinematics.

@article{Haywood2018b,
	Abstract = {{We investigate the nature of the double color-magnitude sequence
observed in the Gaia DR2 HR diagram of stars with high transverse
velocities. The stars in the reddest-color sequence are likely dominated
by the dynamically hot tail of the thick disk population. Information
from Nissen {\amp} Schuster and from the APOGEE survey suggests that
stars in the blue-color sequence have elemental abundance patterns that
can be explained by this population having a relatively low star
formation efficiency during its formation. In dynamical and orbital
spaces, such as the {\ldquo}Toomre diagram,{\rdquo} the two sequences show
a significant overlap, but with a tendency for stars on the blue-color
sequence to dominate regions with no or retrograde rotation and high
total orbital energy. In the plane defined by the maximal vertical
excursion of the orbits versus their apocenters, stars of both sequences
redistribute into discrete wedges. We conclude that stars that are
typically assigned to the halo in the solar vicinity are actually both
accreted stars lying along the blue sequence in the HR diagram, and the
low rotational velocity tail of the old Galactic disk, possibly
dynamically heated by past accretion events. Our results imply that a
halo population formed in situ and responsible for the early chemical
enrichment prior to the formation of the thick disk has yet to be
robustly identified, and that what has been defined as the stars of the
in situ stellar halo of the Galaxy may in fact be fossil records of its
last significant merger.

@article{Nissen2012,
	Abstract = {{Context. A previous study of F and G main-sequence stars in the solar
neighborhood has revealed the existence of two distinct halo populations
with a clear separation in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] for the metallicity range -1.4
$\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.7. Taking into account the kinematics and ages of
the stars, some Galactic formation models suggest that the ``high-alpha''
halo stars were formed in situ, whereas the ``low-alpha'' stars have been
accreted from satellite galaxies. <BR /> Aims: In this paper we
investigate if there is a systematic difference in the lithium
abundances of stars belonging to the high- and low-alpha halo
populations. <BR /> Methods: Equivalent widths of the Li i 6707.8
{\AA} resonance line are measured from high resolution VLT/UVES and
NOT/FIES spectra and used to derive Li abundances on the basis of MARCS
model atmospheres. Furthermore, masses of the stars are determined from
the log T$_{eff}$ - log g diagram by interpolating between
evolutionary tracks based on Yonsei-Yale models. <BR /> Results: There
is no significant systematic difference in the lithium abundances of
high- and low-alpha stars. For the large majority of stars with masses
0.7 $\lt$ M/M$_{&sun;}$ $\lt$ 0.9 and heavy-element mass fractions
0.001 {\lsim} Z $\lt$ 0.006, the lithium abundance is well fitted by a
relation A(Li) = a$_{0}$ + a$_{1}$ M + a$_{2}$ Z +
a$_{3}$ M Z, where a$_{0}$, a$_{1}$, a$_{2}$,
and a$_{3}$ are constants. Extrapolating this relation to Z = 0
leads to a lithium abundance close to the primordial value predicted
from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations and the WMAP baryon
density. The relation, however, does not apply to stars with
metallicities below [Fe/H] {\sime} - 1.5. <BR /> Conclusions: We suggest
that metal-rich halo stars were formed with a lithium abundance close to
the primordial value, and that lithium in their atmospheres has been
depleted in time with an approximately linear dependence on stellar mass
and Z. The lack of a systematic difference in the Li abundances of high-
and low-alpha stars indicates that an environmental effect is not
important for the destruction of lithium.

	Abstract = {{Obtaining accurate and precise masses and ages for large numbers of
        giant stars is of great importance for unraveling the assemblage
        history of the Galaxy. In this paper, we estimate masses and
        ages of 6940 red giant branch (RGB) stars with asteroseismic
        parameters deduced from Kepler photometry and stellar
        atmospheric parameters derived from LAMOST spectra. The typical
        uncertainties of mass is a few per cent, and that of age is
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}20 per cent. The sample stars reveal two
        separate sequences in the age-[{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe]
        relation - a high-{\ensuremath{\alpha}} sequence with stars
        older than {\ensuremath{\sim}}8 Gyr and a
        low-{\ensuremath{\alpha}} sequence composed of stars with ages
        ranging from younger than 1 Gyr to older than 11 Gyr. We further
        investigate the feasibility of deducing ages and masses directly
        from LAMOST spectra with a machine learning method based on
        kernel based principal component analysis, taking a sub-sample
        of these RGB stars as a training data set. We demonstrate that
        ages thus derived achieve an accuracy of {\ensuremath{\sim}}24
        per cent. We also explored the feasibility of estimating ages
        and masses based on the spectroscopically measured carbon and
        nitrogen abundances. The results are quite satisfactory and
        significantly improved compared to the previous studies.}},

	Abstract = {{Distances to individual stars in our own Galaxy are critical in order to
        piece together the nature of its velocity and spatial structure.
        Core helium burning red clump (RC) stars have similar
        luminosities, are abundant throughout the Galaxy and thus
        constitute good standard candles. We build a hierarchical
        probabilistic model to quantify the quality of RC stars as
        standard candles using parallax measurements from the first Gaia
        data release. A unique aspect of our methodology is to fully
        account for (and marginalize over) parallax, photometry and dust
        correction uncertainties, which lead to more robust results than
        standard approaches. We determine the absolute magnitude and
        intrinsic dispersion of the RC in 2MASS bands J, H, K$_{s}$,
        Gaia G band and WISE bands W1, W2, W3 and W4. We find that the
        absolute magnitude of the RC is -1.61 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.01
        (in K$_{s}$), +0.44 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.01 (in G), -0.93
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.01 (in J), -1.46 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.01
        (in H), -1.68 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02 (in W1), -1.69
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02 (in W2), -1.67 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02
        (in W3) and -1.76 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.01 mag (in W4). The mean
        intrinsic dispersion is {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.17
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 mag across all bands (yielding a typical
        distance precision of {\ensuremath{\sim}}8 per cent). Thus RC
        stars are reliable and precise standard candles. In addition, we
        have also re-calibrated the zero-point of the absolute magnitude
        of the RC in each band, which provides a benchmark for future
        studies to estimate distances to RC stars. Finally, the parallax
        error shrinkage in the hierarchical model outlined in this work
        can be used to obtain more precise parallaxes than Gaia for the
        most distant RC stars across the Galaxy.}},

	Abstract = {{This study is based on the use of the new ExoMol TiO rovibronic line
        lists to identify and model TiO isotopologue features in spectra
        of M-dwarfs. We aim to investigate problems involving the
        computation of electronic bands for different isotopologues of
        TiO by modelling optical spectra of late-type stars and to
        determine their Ti isotopic abundances, to compare the TiO
        isotopologues spectra computed using line lists by different
        authors. We fit theoretical synthetic spectra to the observed
        stellar molecular bands of TiO. We model spectra of two
        M-dwarfs: GJ 15A (M1V) and GJ 15B (M3 V) to determine Ti
        isotopic ratios in their atmospheres. We demonstrate the
        accuracy of the ExoMol \{\textbackslashsc Toto\} line list for
        differentisotopologues of TiO and the possibility of determining
        accurate Ti isotope abundances in a numberof spectral ranges.
        The 7580--7594 {\r{A}} spectral range seems particularly useful,
        with two atomic linesof Fe I and molecular band heads of
        $^{50}Ti$O, $^{49}Ti$O, $^{48}Ti$O, $^{47}Ti$O clearly
        observable in our two M-dwarf spectra. We determine non-solar Ti
        isotopic ratios of $^{46}Ti$ : $^{47}Ti$ : $^{48}Ti$ : $^{49}Ti$
        : $^{50}Ti$ = 7.9 : 5.2 : 72.8 : 7.9 :6.2 for GJ 15A and 7.4 :

        determined for GJ 15A and GJ 15B, respectively. We find that the
        ExoMol \{\textbackslashsc Toto\} TiO line list: a) describes the
        fine details in line position and intensities of the M-dwarf
        spectra better than other available TiO line lists; b) correctly
        reproduces the positions and intensities of the TiO isotopologue

	Abstract = {{We present mass models of the Milky Way created to fit observational
        constraints and to be consistent with expectations from
        theoretical modelling. The method used to create these models is
        that demonstrated in our previous study, and we improve on those
        models by adding gas discs to the potential, considering the
        effects of allowing the inner slope of the halo density profile
        to vary, and including new observations of maser sources in the
        Milky Way amongst the new constraints. We provide a best-fitting
        model, as well as estimates of the properties of the Milky Way.
        Under the assumptions in our main model, we find that the Sun is
        R$_{0}$ = 8.20 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.09 kpc from the Galactic
        Centre, with the circular speed at the Sun being v$_{0}$ = 232.8
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3.0 km s$^{-1}$; and that the Galaxy has a
        total stellar mass of (54.3 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 5.7) {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{9}$ M$_{☉}$, a total virial mass of (1.30
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.30) {\texttimes} {}10$^{12}$ M$_{☉}$ and a
        local dark-matter density of 0.40 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.04 GeV
        cm$^{-3}$, where the quoted uncertainties are statistical. These
        values are sensitive to our choice of priors and constraints. We
        investigate systematic uncertainties, which in some cases may be
        larger. For example, if we weaken our prior on R$_{0}$, we find
        it to be 7.97 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.15 kpc and that v$_{0}$ =
        226.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 4.2 km s$^{-1}$. We find that most of
        these properties, including the local dark-matter density, are
        remarkably insensitive to the assumed power-law density slope at
        the centre of the dark-matter halo. We find that it is unlikely
        that the local standard of rest differs significantly from that
        found under assumptions of axisymmetry. We have made code to
        compute the force from our potential, and to integrate orbits
        within it, publicly available.}},

	Abstract = {{\textbackslash Aims: Several kinematic and chemical substructures have
        been recently found amongst Milky Way halo stars with retrograde
        motions. It is currently unclear how these various structures
        are related to each other. This Letter aims to shed light on
        this issue. \textbackslash Methods: We explore the retrograde
        halo with an augmented version of the Gaia DR2 RVS sample,
        extended with data from three large spectroscopic surveys,
        namely RAVE, APOGEE, and LAMOST. In this dataset, we identify
        several structures using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm. We
        discuss their properties and possible links using all the
        available chemical and dynamical information. \textbackslash
        Results: In concordance with previous work, we find that stars
        with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1 have more retrograde motions than those
        with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -1. The retrograde halo contains a mixture of
        debris from objects like Gaia-Enceladus, Sequoia, and even the
        chemically defined thick disc. We find that the Sequoia has a
        smaller range in orbital energies than previously suggested and
        is confined to high energy. Sequoia could be a small galaxy in
        itself, but since it overlaps both in integrals-of-motion space
        and chemical abundance space with the less bound debris of Gaia-
        Enceladus, its nature cannot yet be fully settled. In the low-
        energy part of the halo, we find evidence for at least one more
        distinct structure: Thamnos. Stars in Thamnos are on low-
        inclination, mildly eccentric retrograde orbits, moving at
        v$_{{\ensuremath{\phi}}}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} -150 km
        s$^{-1}$, and are chemically distinct from the other structures.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: Even with the excellent Gaia DR2
        data, piecing together all the fragments found in the retrograde
        halo remains challenging. At this point, we are very much in
        need of large datasets with high-quality high-resolution spectra
        and tailored high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of
        galaxy mergers.}},

	Abstract = {{We present the first chemical evolution model for Enceladus, alias the
        Gaia Sausage, to investigate the star formation history of one
        of the most massive satellites accreted by the Milky Way during
        a major merger event. Our best chemical evolution model for
        Enceladus nicely fits the observed stellar
        [{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe]-[Fe/H] chemical abundance trends, and
        reproduces the observed stellar metallicity distribution
        function, by assuming low star formation efficiency, fast infall
        time-scale, and mild outflow intensity. We predict a median age
        for Enceladus stars 12.33\^\{+0.92\}\_\{-1.36\} Gyr, and - at
        the time of the merger with our Galaxy ({\ensuremath{\approx}}10
        Gyr ago from Helmi et al.) - we predict for Enceladus a total
        stellar mass M$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} 5
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$ M$_{\textbackslashodot}$. By looking at
        the predictions of our best model, we discuss that merger events
        between the Galaxy and systems like Enceladus may have inhibited
        the gas accretion on to the Galaxy disc at high redshifts,
        heating up the gas in the halo. This scenario could explain the
        extended period of quenching in the star formation activity of
        our Galaxy about 10 Gyr ago, which is predicted by Milky Way
        chemical evolution models, in order to reproduce the observed
        bimodality in [{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe]-[Fe/H] between thick-
        and thin-disc stars.}},

	Abstract = {{Stars born at the same time in the same place should have formed from
        gas of the same element composition. But most stars subsequently
        disperse from their birth siblings, in orbit and orbital phase,
        becoming 'field stars'. Here, we explore and provide direct
        observational evidence for this process in the Milky Way disc,
        by quantifying the probability that orbit-similarity among stars
        implies indistinguishable metallicity. We define the orbit
        similarity among stars through their distance in action-angle
        space, {\ensuremath{\Delta}}(J, {\ensuremath{\theta}}), and
        their abundance similarity simply by
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}[Fe/H]. Analysing a sample of main-sequence
        stars from Gaia DR2 and LAMOST, we find an excess of pairs with
        the same metallicity ({\ensuremath{\Delta}}[Fe/H] $\lt$ 0.1)
        that extends to remarkably large separations in
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}(J, {\ensuremath{\theta}}) that correspond
        to nearly 1 kpc distances. We assess the significance of this
        effect through a mock sample, drawn from a smooth and phase-
        mixed orbit distribution. Through grouping such star pairs into
        associations with a friend-of-friends algorithm linked by
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}(J,{\ensuremath{\theta}}), we find 100s of
        mono-abundance groups with {\ensuremath{\geq}}3 (to
        {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}20) members; these groups - some clusters,
        some spread across the sky - are over an order-of-magnitude more
        abundant than expected for a smooth phase-space distribution,
        suggesting that we are witnessing the 'dissolution' of stellar
        birth associations into the field.}},

        poor (CEMP) stars. The GALAH (GALactic Archaeology with Hermes)
        is a magnitude-limited survey of stars producing high-

        and unsupervised classification algorithm, relying on the
        imprint of the Swan bands. We identified 918 carbon-enhanced

        unbiased selection function of the GALAH survey allows us to
        perform a population study of carbon-enhanced stars. Most of

	Abstract = {{We revisit the observed frequencies of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP)
        stars as a function of the metallicity in the Galaxy, using data
        from the literature with available high-resolution spectroscopy.
        Our analysis excludes stars exhibiting clear overabundances of
        neutron-capture elements and takes into account the expected
        depletion of surface carbon abundance that occurs due to CN
        processing on the upper red giant branch. This allows for the
        recovery of the initial carbon abundance of these stars, and
        thus for an accurate assessment of the frequencies of carbon-
        enhanced stars. The correction procedure we develop is based on
        stellar-evolution models and depends on the surface gravity, log
        g, of a given star. Our analysis indicates that for stars with
        [Fe/H] $\lt$=-2.0, 20\% exhibit [C/Fe] $\gt$=+0.7. This fraction
        increases to 43\% for [Fe/H] $\lt$=-3.0 and 81\% for [Fe/H]
        $\lt$=-4.0, which is higher than have been previously inferred
        without taking the carbon abundance correction into account.
        These CEMP star frequencies provide important inputs for
        Galactic and stellar chemical evolution models, as they
        constrain the evolution of carbon at early times and the
        possible formation channels for the CEMP-no stars. We also have
        developed a public online tool with which carbon corrections
        using our procedure can be easily obtained.}},

	Abstract = {The vast majority of stars with mass similar to that of the Sun are expected to destroy lithium (Li) gradually over the course of their lives, via low-temperature nuclear burning. This has now been supported by observations of hundreds of thousands of red giant stars1--5. Here we perform a large-scale systematic investigation into the Li content of stars in the red clump phase of evolution, which directly follows the red giant branch phase. Surprisingly, we find that all red clump stars have high levels of Li for their evolutionary stage, with an increase of a factor of 40 over the end of the red giant branch stage, on average. This suggests that all low-mass stars undergo an Li production phase between the tip of the red giant branch and the red clump. We demonstrate that our finding is not predicted by stellar theory, revealing a stark tension between observations and models. We also show that the well-studied1,2,4--6 very Li-rich giants, with A(Li) > +1.5 dex, represent only the extreme tail of the Li enhancement distribution, comprising 3{\%} of red clump stars. Our findings suggest a new definition limit for Li-richness in red clump stars, A(Li) > −0.9 dex, which is much lower than the limit of A(Li) > +1.5 dex used over many decades1,5--9.},

	Abstract = {{To accurately interpret the observed properties of exoplanets, it is
        necessary to first obtain a detailed understanding of host star
        properties. However, physical models that analyze stellar
        properties on a per-star basis can become computationally
        intractable for sufficiently large samples. Furthermore, these
        models are limited by the wavelength coverage of available
        spectra. We combine previously derived spectral properties from
        the Spectroscopic Properties of Cool Stars (SPOCS) catalog
        (Brewer et al. 2016) with generative modeling using The Cannon
        to produce a model capable of deriving stellar parameters ($\log
        g$, $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and $v\sin i$) and 15 elemental
        abundances (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni,
        and Y) for stellar spectra observed with Keck Observatory's High
        Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES). We demonstrate the high
        accuracy and precision of our model, which takes just $\sim$3
        seconds to classify each star, through cross-validation with
        pre-labeled spectra from the SPOCS sample. Our trained model,
        which takes continuum-normalized template spectra as its inputs,
        is publicly available at https://github.com/malenarice/keckspec.
        Finally, we interpolate our spectra and employ the same modeling
        scheme to recover labels for 477 stars using archival stellar
        spectra obtained prior to Keck's 2004 detector upgrade,
        demonstrating that our interpolated model can successfully
        predict stellar labels for different spectrographs that have (1)
        sufficiently similar systematics and (2) a wavelength range that
        substantially overlaps with that of the post-2004 HIRES spectra.}},

	Abstract = {{In the era of large spectroscopic surveys, massive databases of high-
        quality spectra provide tools to outline a new picture of our
        Galaxy. In this framework, an important piece of information is
        provided by our ability to infer stellar ages. We aim to provide
        empirical relations between stellar ages and abundance ratios
        for a sample of solar-like stars. We investigate the dependence
        on metallicity, and we apply our relations to Gaia-ESO samples
        of open clusters and field stars. We analyse high-resolution and
        high-S/N HARPS spectra of a sample of solar-like stars to obtain
        precise determinations of their atmospheric parameters and
        abundances through differential spectral analysis and age
        through isochrone fitting. We investigate the relations between
        ages and abundance ratios. For the abundance ratios with a
        steeper dependence on age, we perform multivariate linear
        regressions, including the dependence on metallicity. We apply
        our relations to a sample of open clusters located in
        4\&lt;R$_{GC}$\&lt;16 kpc. Using them, we are able to recover
        the literature ages only for clusters located at R$_{GC}$\&gt;7
        kpc. In these clusters, the content of s-elements is lower than
        expected from chemical evolution models, and consequently the
        [s/$\alpha$] are lower than in clusters of the same age located
        in the solar neighbourhood. With our chemical evolution model
        and a set of empirical yields, we suggest that a strong
        dependence on the star formation history and metallicity-
        dependent yields of s-elements can substantially modify the
        slope of the [s/$\alpha$]-[Fe/H]-age relation in different
        regions of the Galaxy. Our results point towards a non-universal
        relation [s/$\alpha$]-[Fe/H]-age, indicating the existence of
        relations at different R$_{GC}$ or for different star formation
        history. A better understanding of the s-process at high
        metallicity is necessary to fully understand the origin of these
        variations.}},

	Abstract = {{We present a catalog of uniformly determined stellar properties and
        abundances for 1,617 F, G, and K stars using an automated
        spectral synthesis modeling procedure. All stars were observed
        using the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Our procedure
        used a single line list to fit model spectra to observations of
        all stars to determine effective temperature, surface gravity,
        metallicity, projected rotational velocity, and the abundances
        of 15 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe,
        Ni, and Y). Sixty percent of the sample had Hipparcos parallaxes
        and V-band photometry, which we combined with the spectroscopic
        results to obtain mass, radius, and luminosity. Additionally, we
        used the luminosity, effective temperature, metallicity and
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-element enhancement to interpolate in the
        Yonsei-Yale isochrones to derive mass, radius, gravity, and age
        ranges for those stars. Finally, we determined new relations
        between effective temperature and macroturbulence for dwarfs and
        subgiants. Our analysis achieved precisions of 25 K in
        \{T\}$_{\{eff}$\}, 0.01 dex in [M/H], 0.028 dex for \{log\}g,
        and 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ in v\textbackslashsin I based on multiple
        observations of the same stars. The abundance results were
        similarly precise, between {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.01 and
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.04 dex, though trends with respect to
        \{T\}$_{\{eff}$\} remained for which we derived empirical
        corrections. The trends, though small, were much larger than our
        uncertainties and are shared with published abundances. We show
        that changing our model atmosphere grid accounts for most of the
        trend in [M/H] between 5000 and 5500 K, indicating a possible
        problem with the atmosphere models or opacities.}},

	Abstract = {{Swan bands - characteristic molecular absorption features of the C$_{2}$
        molecule - are a spectroscopic signature of carbon-enhanced
        stars. They can also be used to identify carbon-enhanced metal-
        poor (CEMP) stars. The GALAH (GALactic Archaeology with Hermes)
        is a magnitude-limited survey of stars producing high-
        resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra. We used 627 708 GALAH
        spectra to search for carbon-enhanced stars with a supervised
        and unsupervised classification algorithm, relying on the
        imprint of the Swan bands. We identified 918 carbon-enhanced
        stars, including 12 already described in the literature. An
        unbiased selection function of the GALAH survey allows us to
        perform a population study of carbon-enhanced stars. Most of
        them are giants, out of which we find 28 CEMP candidates. A
        large fraction of our carbon-enhanced stars with repeated
        observations show variation in radial velocity, hinting that
        there is a large fraction of variables among them. 32 of the
        detected stars also show strong Lithium enhancement in their
        spectra.}},

	Abstract = {{The abundance ratios of manganese to iron in late-type stars across a
        wide metallicity range place tight constraints on the
        astrophysical production sites of Fe-group elements. In this
        work, we investigate the chemical evolution of Mn in the Milky
        Way galaxy using high-resolution spectroscopic observations of
        stars in the Galactic disc and halo stars, as well as a sample
        of globular clusters. Our analysis shows that local
        thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) leads to a strong imbalance in
        the ionisation equilibrium of Mn I and Mn II lines. Mn I
        produces systematically (up to 0.6 dex) lower abundances
        compared to the Mn II lines. Non-LTE (NLTE) radiative transfer
        satisfies the ionisation equilibrium across the entire
        metallicity range, of -3 {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} [Fe/H]
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} -1, leading to consistent abundances
        from both ionisation stages of the element. We compare the NLTE
        abundances with Galactic Chemical Evolution models computed
        using different sources of type Ia and type II supernova (SN Ia
        and SN II) yields. We find that a good fit to our observations
        can be obtained by assuming that a significant
        ({\ensuremath{\sim}}75\%) fraction of SNe Ia stem from a sub-
        Chandrasekhar (sub-M$_{ch}$) channel. While this fraction is
        larger than that found in earlier studies
        ({\ensuremath{\sim}}50\%), we note that we still require
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}25\% near-M$_{ch}$ SNe Ia to obtain solar
        [Mn/Fe] at [Fe/H] = 0. Our new data also suggest higher SN II Mn
        yields at low metallicity than typically assumed in the

	Abstract = {{The discrepancy between cosmological Li abundance inferred from
        Population II dwarf stars and that derived from big bang
        nucleosynthesis calculations is still far from being
        satisfactorily solved. We investigated, as an alternative route,
        the use of Li abundances in Population II lower red giant branch
        stars as empirical diagnostic of the cosmological Li. Both
        theory and observations suggest that the surface Li abundance in
        metal-poor red giants after the completion of the first dredge-
        up and before the red giant branch bump is significantly less
        sensitive to the efficiency of atomic diffusion, compared with
        dwarf stars. The surface Li abundances in these objects - after
        the dilution caused by the first dredge-up - are predicted to be
        sensitive to the total Li content left in the star, i.e. they
        are affected only by the total amount of Li eventually burned
        during the previous main-sequence phase. Standard stellar models
        computed under different physical assumptions show that the
        inclusion of the atomic diffusion has an impact of about 0.07
        dex in the determination of the primordial Li abundance - much
        smaller than the case of metal-poor main-sequence turnoff stars
        - and it is basically unaffected by reasonable variations of
        other parameters (overshooting, age, initial He abundance and
        mixing length). We have determined from spectroscopy the surface
        Li content of 17 halo lower red giant branch stars, in the
        metallicity range between [Fe/H] {\ensuremath{\sim}}- 3.4 and
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}- 1.4 dex, evolving before the extramixing
        episode that sets in at the red giant branch bump. The initial
        Li (customarily taken as estimate of the cosmological Li
        abundance A(Li)$_{0}$) has then been inferred by accounting for
        the difference between initial and post-dredge-up Li abundances
        in the appropriate stellar models. It depends mainly on the
        T$_{eff}$ scale adopted in the spectroscopic analysis, and is
        only weakly sensitive to the efficiency of atomic diffusion in
        the models, so long as one neglects Li destruction caused by the
        process competing with atomic diffusion. Our final A(Li)$_{0}$
        estimate spans a relatively narrow range, between 2.28 and 2.46
        dex, and is {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.3-0.4 dex lower than
        predictions from big bang nucleosynthesis calculations. These
        values of A(Li)$_{0}$ are corroborated by the analysis of
        samples of red giants in the Galactic globular clusters NGC
        6397, NGC 6752 and M4. Our result provides an independent
        quantitative estimate of the difference with the big bang value,
        and sets a very robust constraint for the physical processes
        invoked to resolve this discrepancy. Based on observations

	Abstract = {{Data-driven methods play an increasingly important role in the field of
        astrophysics. In the context of large spectroscopic surveys of
        stars, data-driven methods are key in deducing physical
        parameters for millions of spectra in a short time.
        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enable us to connect
        observables (e.g., spectra, stellar magnitudes) to physical
        properties (atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, or
        labels in general). We trained a CNN, adopting stellar
        atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from APOGEE DR16
        (resolution R\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde22500) data as
        training set labels. As input we used parts of the intermediate-
        resolution RAVE DR6 spectra
        (R\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde7500) overlapping with the
        APOGEE DR16 data as well as broad-band ALL\_WISE and 2MASS
        photometry together with Gaia DR2 photometry and parallaxes. We
        derived precise atmospheric parameters Teff, log(g), [M/H] and
        chemical abundances of [Fe/H], [alpha/M], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe],
        [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] for 420165 RAVE spectra. The precision
        typically amounts to 60K in Teff, 0.06 in log(g), and 0.02-0.04
        dex for individual chemical abundances. Incorporating photometry
        and astrometry as additional constraints substantially improves
        the results in terms of accuracy and precision of the derived
        labels, as long as we operate in parts of the parameter space
        that is well covered by the training sample. Scientific
        validation confirms the robustness of the CNN results. We
        provide a catalog of CNN-trained atmospheric parameters and
        abundances along with their uncertainties for 420165 stars in
        the RAVE survey. CNN-based methods provide a powerful way to
        combine spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric data,
        without applying any priors in the form of stellar evolutionary
        models. The developed procedure can extend the scientific output
        of RAVE spectra beyond DR6 to on-going and planned surveys such
        as Gaia RVS and 4MOST.}},

        [X/Fe], and ages, along with orbits, for red clump stars from

        expectation and observational evidence that metallicity ([Fe/H])
        and age are informative about a star{\textquoteright}s orbit,
        e.g., about its angular momentum and the corresponding mean

        analysis of the APOGEE data confirms that [Fe/H] or age alone
        can predict the stars{\textquoteright} orbits far less well than
        a combination of the two. Remarkably, we find and show
        explicitly that, for known [Fe/H] and age, the other abundances
        [X/Fe] of Galactic disk stars can be predicted well (on average
        to 0.02 dex) across a wide range of Galactocentric radii, and
        therefore provide little additional information, e.g., for
        predicting their orbit. While the age-abundance space for metal-
        poor stars and potentially for stars near the Galactic center is
        rich or complex, for the bulk of the Galaxy{\textquoteright}s
        low-{\ensuremath{\alpha}} disk it is simple: [Fe/H] and age
        contain most information, unless [X/Fe] can be measured to 0.02
        or better. Consequently, we do not have the precision with
        current (and likely near-future) data to assign stars to their
        individual (coeval) birth clusters, from which the disk is
        presumably formed. We can, however, place strong constraints on

@article{Frankel2020,
	Abstract = {{A star in the Milky Way's disk can now be at a Galactocentric radius
        quite distant from its birth radius for two reasons: either its
        orbit has become eccentric through radial heating, which
        increases its radial action $J_R$ (`blurring'); or merely its
        angular momentum $L_z$ has changed and thereby its guiding
        radius (`churning'). We know that radial orbit migration is
        strong in the Galactic low-$\alpha$ disk and set out to quantify
        the relative importance of these two effects, by devising and
        applying a parameterized model for the distribution $p(L_z, J_R,
        \tau, \mathrm[Fe/H])$ in the stellar disk. This model describes
        the orbit evolution for stars of age $\tau$ and metallicity
        [Fe/H], presuming coeval stars were initially born on
        (near-)circular orbits, and with a unique [Fe/H] at a given
        birth angular momentum and age. We fit this model to APOGEE red
        clump stars, accounting for the complex selection function of
        the survey. The best fit model implies changes of angular
        momentum of $\sqrt{\langle \Delta L_z \rangle^2} \approx 619\,
        \mathrm{kpc~km/s~}(\tau/\mathrm{6~Gyr})^{0.5}$, and changes of
        radial action as $\sqrt{\langle \Delta J_R \rangle^2} \approx
        63\, \mathrm{kpc~km/s~} (\tau/\mathrm{6~Gyr})^{0.6}$ at 8 kpc.
        This suggests that the secular orbit evolution of the disk is
        dominated by diffusion in angular momentum, with radial heating
        being an order of magnitude lower.}},

        determined from the [O I] line at 6300 {\r{A}}. The mean
        abundances of C, N and O abundances in the investigated clump
        stars support our previous estimations that, compared to the Sun
        and dwarf stars of the Galactic disc, carbon is depleted by
        about 0.2 dex, nitrogen is enhanced by 0.2 dex and oxygen is
        close to abundances in dwarfs. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and C/N
        ratios for galactic red clump stars analysed were compared to
        the evolutionary models of extra-mixing. The steeper drop of
        $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in the model of thermohaline mixing by
        Charbonnel \&amp; Lagarde better reflects the observational data
        at low stellar masses than the more shallow model of cool bottom
        processing by Boothroyd \&amp; Sackmann. For stars of about 2
        M$_{☉}$ masses a modelling of rotationally induced mixing should
        be considered with rotation of about 250 km s$^{-1}$ at the time
        when a star was at the hydrogen-core-burning stage.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. Open clusters are recognised as excellent tracers of Galactic
        thin-disc properties. At variance with intermediate-age and old
        open clusters, for which a significant number of studies is now
        available, clusters younger than {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}150 Myr
        have been mostly overlooked in terms of their chemical
        composition until recently (with few exceptions). On the other
        hand, previous investigations seem to indicate an anomalous
        behaviour of young clusters, which includes (but is not limited
        to) slightly sub-solar iron (Fe) abundances and extreme,
        unexpectedly high barium (Ba) enhancements. <BR /> Aims: In a
        series of papers, we plan to expand our understanding of this
        topic and investigate whether these chemical peculiarities are
        instead related to abundance analysis techniques. <BR />
        Methods: We present a new determination of the atmospheric
        parameters for 23 dwarf stars observed by the Gaia-ESO survey in
        five young open clusters ({\ensuremath{\tau}} \&lt; 150 Myr) and
        one star-forming region (NGC 2264). We exploit a new method
        based on titanium (Ti) lines to derive the spectroscopic surface
        gravity, and most importantly, the microturbulence parameter. A
        combination of Ti and Fe lines is used to obtain effective
        temperatures. We also infer the abundances of Fe I, Fe II, Ti I,
        Ti II, Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, Ca I, Cr I, and Ni I. <BR />
        Results: Our findings are in fair agreement with Gaia-ESO iDR5
        results for effective temperatures and surface gravities, but
        suggest that for very young stars, the microturbulence parameter
        is over-estimated when Fe lines are employed. This affects the
        derived chemical composition and causes the metal content of
        very young clusters to be under-estimated. <BR /> Conclusions:
        Our clusters display a metallicity [Fe/H] between +0.04
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.01 and +0.12 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02; they
        are not more metal poor than the Sun. Although based on a
        relatively small sample size, our explorative study suggests
        that we may not need to call for ad hoc explanations to
        reconcile the chemical composition of young open clusters with
        Galactic chemical evolution models. <P />Full Table 2 is only

	Abstract = {{Asteroseismology is a promising tool to study Galactic structure and
        evolution because it can probe the ages of stars. Earlier
        attempts comparing seismic data from the Kepler satellite with
        predictions from Galaxy models found that the models predicted
        more low-mass stars compared to the observed distribution of
        masses. It was unclear if the mismatch was due to inaccuracies
        in the Galactic models, or the unknown aspects of the selection
        function of the stars. Using new data from the K2 mission, which
        has a well-defined selection function, we find that an old
        metal-poor thick disc, as used in previous Galactic models, is
        incompatible with the asteroseismic information. We use an
        importance-sampling framework, which takes the selection
        function into account, to fit for the metallicities of a
        population synthesis model using spectroscopic data. We show
        that spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H] and
        [{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe] elemental abundances from the GALAH
        survey indicate a mean metallicity of log (Z/Z$_{☉}$) = -0.16
        for the thick disc. Here Z is the effective solar-scaled
        metallicity, which is a function of [Fe/H] and
        [{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe]. With the revised disc metallicities,
        for the first time, the theoretically predicted distribution of
        seismic masses show excellent agreement with the observed
        distribution of masses. This indirectly verifies that the
        asteroseismic mass scaling relation is good to within five per
        cent. Assuming the asteroseismic scaling relations are correct,
        we estimate the mean age of the thick disc to be about 10 Gyr,
        in agreement with the traditional idea of an old
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-enhanced thick disc.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. Older models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) predict
        [K/Fe] ratios as much as 1 dex lower than those inferred from
        stellar observations. Abundances of potassium are mainly based
        on analyses of the 7698 {\r{A}} resonance line, and the
        discrepancy between GCE models and observations is in part
        caused by the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium
        (LTE) in spectroscopic analyses. <BR /> Aims: We study the
        statistical equilibrium of K I, focusing on the non-LTE effects
        on the 7698 {\r{A}} line. We aim to determine how non-LTE
        abundances of potassium can improve the analysis of its chemical
        evolution, and help to constrain the yields of GCE models. <BR
        /> Methods: We construct a new model K I atom that employs the
        most up-to-date atomic data. In particular, we calculate and
        present inelastic e+K collisional excitation cross-sections from
        the convergent close-coupling (CCC) and the B-Spline R-matrix
        (BSR) methods, and H+K collisions from the two-electron model
        (LCAO). We constructed a fine, extended grid of non-LTE
        abundance corrections based on 1D MARCS models that span 4000
        \&lt; T$_{eff}$/K \&lt; 8000, 0.50 \&lt; log g \&lt; 5.00, -
        5.00 \&lt; [Fe/H] \&lt; + 0.50, and applied the corrections to
        potassium abundances extracted from the literature. <BR />
        Results: In concordance with previous studies, we find severe
        non-LTE effects in the 7698 {\r{A}} line. The line is stronger
        in non-LTE and the abundance corrections can reach approximately
        - 0.7 dex for solar-metallicity stars such as Procyon. We
        determine potassium abundances in six benchmark stars, and
        obtain consistent results from different optical lines. We
        explore the effects of atmospheric inhomogeneity by computing
        for the first time a full 3D non-LTE stellar spectrum of K I
        lines for a test star. We find that 3D modeling is necessary to
        predict a correct shape of the resonance 7698 {\r{A}} line, but
        the line strength is similar to that found in 1D non-LTE. <BR />
        Conclusions: Our non-LTE abundance corrections reduce the
        scatter and change the cosmic trends of literature potassium
        abundances. In the regime [Fe/H] {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}-1.0 the
        non-LTE abundances show a good agreement with the GCE model with
        yields from rotating massive stars. The reduced scatter of the
        non-LTE corrected abundances of a sample of solar twins shows
        that line-by-line differential analysis techniques cannot fully
        compensate for systematic LTE modelling errors; the scatter
        introduced by such errors introduces a spurious dispersion to K
        evolution. <P />Data are only available at the CDS via anonymous

	Abstract = {{The nearby (d = 7.7 pc) A3V star Fomalhaut is orbited by a resolved
        dusty debris disk and a controversial candidate extrasolar
        planet. The commonly cited age for the system (200
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 100 Myr) from Barrado y Navascues et al.
        relied on a combination of isochronal age plus youth indicators
        for the K4V common proper-motion system TW PsA. TW PsA is 1fdg96
        away from Fomalhaut and was first proposed as a companion by
        Luyten, but the physicality of the binarity is worth testing
        with modern data. I demonstrate that TW PsA is unequivocally a
        physical stellar companion to Fomalhaut, with true separation
        0.280$^{+0.019}$ $_{- 0.012}$ pc (57.4$^{+3.9}$ $_{- 2.5}$ kAU)
        and sharing velocities within 0.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5 km
        s$^{-1}${\textemdash}consistent with being a bound system.
        Hence, TW PsA should be considered ``Fomalhaut B.'' Combining
        modern H-R diagram constraints with four sets of evolutionary
        tracks, and assuming the star was born with protosolar
        composition, I estimate a new isochronal age for Fomalhaut of
        450 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 40 Myr and mass of 1.92
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02 M $_{☉}$. Various stellar youth
        diagnostics are re-examined for TW PsA. The star's rotation,
        X-ray emission, and Li abundances are consistent with
        approximate ages of 410, 380, and 360 Myr, respectively,
        yielding a weighted mean age of 400 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 70 Myr.
        Combining the independent ages, I estimate a mean age for the
        Fomalhaut-TW PsA binary of 440 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 40 Myr. The

	Abstract = {{Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693
        million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on
        observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia
        satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase.
        <BR /> Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing
        used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation
        of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. <BR />
        Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-
        processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the
        five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper
        motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at
        the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly
        faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First,
        the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration
        parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global
        iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about
        1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the
        extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by
        means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were
        then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the
        sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise
        the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion.
        <BR /> Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric
        solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at
        the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G
        \&lt; 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G =
        20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding
        uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr$^{-1}$,
        respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is
        aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the
        quasars to within 0.15 mas yr$^{-1}$. From the quasars and
        validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the
        parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are
        generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too
        small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up
        to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$ in proper motion
        are seen on small (\&lt; 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg)
        angular scales. Important statistics and information for the
        users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.}},

	Abstract = {{There has been an incredibly large investment in obtaining high-
        resolution stellar spectra for determining chemical abundances
        of stars. This information is crucial to answer fundamental
        questions in astronomy by constraining the formation and
        evolution scenarios of the Milky Way as well as the stars and
        planets residing in it. We have just entered a new era, in which
        chemical abundances of FGK-type stars are being produced at
        industrial scales, and in which the observations, reduction, and
        analysis of the data are automatically performed by machines.
        Here, we review the latest human efforts to assess the accuracy
        and precision of such industrial abundances by providing
        insights into the steps and uncertainties associated with the
        process of determining stellar abundances. We also provide a
        description of current and forthcoming spectroscopic surveys,
        focusing on their reported abundances and uncertainties. This
        allows us to identify which elements and spectral lines are best
        and why. Finally, we make a brief selection of main scientific
        questions the community is aiming to answer with abundances.
        Uncertainties in abundances need to be disentangled into random
        and systematic components. Precision can be increased by
        applying differential or data-driven methods based on accurate
        data. High-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra provide
        fundamental data that can be used to calibrate lower-resolution
        and signal-to-noise spectra of millions of stars. Different
        survey calibration strategies must agree on a common set of
        reference stars to create data products that are consistent.
        Data products provided by individual groups must be published
        using standard formats to ensure straightforward applicability.

	Abstract = {{Despite the recent availability of large samples of stars with high-
        precision Li abundances, there are many unanswered questions
        about the evolution of this unique element in the Galaxy and in
        the stars themselves. It is unclear which parameters and
        physical mechanisms govern Li depletion in late-type stars and
        if Galactic enrichment has proceeded differently in different
        stellar populations. With this study we aim to explore these
        questions further by mapping the evolution of Li with stellar
        mass, age, and effective temperature for Milky Way disk stars,
        linking the metal-poor and metal-rich regimes, and how Li
        differs in the thin and thick disks. We determine Li abundances
        for a well-studied sample of 714 F and G dwarf, turn-off, and
        subgiant stars in the solar neighbourhood. The analysis is based
        on line synthesis of the $^{7}$Li line at 6707 {\r{A}} in high-
        resolution and high-signal-to-noise ratio echelle spectra,
        obtained with the MIKE, FEROS, SOFIN, UVES, and FIES
        spectrographs. The presented Li abundances are corrected for
        non-LTE effects. Out of the sample of 714 stars, we are able to
        determine Li abundances for 394 stars and upper limits on the Li
        abundance for another 121 stars. Out of 36 stars that are listed
        as exoplanet host stars, 18 have well-determined Li abundances
        and 6 have Li upper limits. Our main finding is that there are
        no signatures of Li production in stars associated with the
        thick disk. Instead the Li abundance trend is decreasing with
        metallicity for these thick disk stars. Significant Li
        production is however seen in the thin disk, with a steady
        increase towards super-solar metallicities. At the highest
        metallicities, however, around [Fe/H] {\ensuremath{\approx}}
        +0.3, we tentatively confirm the recent discovery that the Li
        abundances level out. Our finding contradicts the other recent
        studies that found that Li is also produced in the thick disk.
        We find that this is likely due to the
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-enhancement criteria which those studies
        used to define their thick disk samples. By using the more
        robust age criteria, we are able to define a thick disk stellar
        sample that is much less contaminated by thin disk stars.
        Furthermore, we also tentatively confirm the age-Li correlation
        for solar twin stars, and we find that there is no correlation
        between Li abundance and whether the stars have detected
        exoplanets or not. The major conclusion that can be drawn from
        this study is that no significant Li production relative to the
        primordial abundance took place during the first few billion
        years of the Milky Way, an era coinciding with the formation and
        evolution of the thick disk. Significant Li enrichment then took
        place once long-lived low-mass stars (acting on a timescale
        longer than SNIa) had had time to contribute to the chemical
        enrichment of the interstellar medium. <P />This paper includes

	Abstract = {{The compositions of stars are a critical diagnostic tool for many topics
        in astronomy such as the evolution of our Galaxy, the formation
        of planets, and the uniqueness of the Sun. Previous
        spectroscopic measurements indicate a large intrinsic variation
        in the elemental abundance patterns of stars with similar
        overall metal content. However, systematic errors arising from
        inaccuracies in stellar models are known to be a limiting factor
        in such studies, and thus it is uncertain to what extent the
        observed diversity of stellar abundance patterns is real. Here
        we report the abundances of 30 elements with precisions of 2\%
        for 79 Sun-like stars within 100 pc. Systematic errors are
        minimized in this study by focusing on solar twin stars and
        performing a line-by-line differential analysis using high-
        resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra. We resolve [X/Fe]
        abundance trends in galactic chemical evolution at precisions of
        10$^{-3}$ dex Gyr$^{-1}$ and reveal that stars with similar ages
        and metallicities have nearly identical abundance patterns.
        Contrary to previous results, we find that the ratios of carbon-
        to-oxygen and magnesium-to-silicon in solar-metallicity stars
        are homogeneous to within 10\% throughout the solar
        neighborhood, implying that exoplanets may exhibit much less
        compositional diversity than previously thought. Finally, we
        demonstrate that the Sun has a subtle deficiency in refractory
        material relative to \&gt;80\% of solar twins (at
        2{\ensuremath{\sigma}} confidence), suggesting a possible
        signpost for planetary systems like our own.}},

        non-LTE analyses of C I lines, that uses a new, physically-
        motivated recipe for the rates of neutral hydrogen impact

        employing a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model solar

        around 0.1 dex in the disk-integrated flux. We also present the

	Abstract = {{The primary goal of Galactic archaeology is to learn about the origin of
        the Milky Way from the detailed chemistry and kinematics of
        millions of stars. Wide-field multifibre spectrographs are
        increasingly used to obtain spectral information for huge
        samples of stars. Some surveys (e.g. GALAH) are attempting to
        measure up to 30 separate elements per star. Stellar abundance
        spectroscopy is a subtle art that requires a very high degree of
        spectral uniformity across each of the fibres. However, wide-
        field spectrographs are notoriously non-uniform due to the fast
        output optics necessary to image many fibre outputs on to the
        detector. We show that precise spectroscopy is possible with
        such instruments across all fibres by employing a photonic comb
        - a device that produces uniformly spaced spots of light on the
        CCD to precisely map complex aberrations. Aberrations are
        parametrized by a set of orthogonal moments with
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}100 independent parameters. We then reproduce
        the observed image by convolving high-resolution spectral
        templates with measured aberrations as opposed to extracting the
        spectra from the observed image. Such a forward modelling
        approach also trivializes some spectroscopic reduction problems
        like fibre cross-talk, and reliably extracts spectra with a
        resolution {\ensuremath{\sim}}2.3 times above the nominal
        resolution of the instrument. Our rigorous treatment of optical
        aberrations also encourages a less conservative spectrograph
        design in the future.}},

        contains stars spanning a wide range of evolutionary phases,
        from G dwarfs to red clump stars. The abundances were derived

        high-resolution spectra (R = 22,500) from the SDSS-IV/Apache

	Abstract = {{Context. Open clusters exquisitely track the Galactic disc chemical
        properties and its time evolution; a substantial number of
        studies and large spectroscopic surveys focus mostly on the
        chemical content of relatively old clusters (age
        {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 1 Gyr). Interestingly, the less studied
        young counterpart populating the solar surrounding has been
        found to be solar (at most), with a notable surprising lack of
        young metal-rich objects. While there is wide consensus about
        the moderately above-solar composition of the Hyades cluster,
        the metallicity of Praesepe is still controversial. Recent
        studies suggest that these two clusters share identical chemical
        composition and age, but this conclusion is disputed. <BR />
        Aims: With the aim of reassessing the metallicity of Praesepe,
        and its difference (if any) with the Hyades cluster, we present
        in this paper a spectroscopic investigation of ten solar-type
        dwarf members. <BR /> Methods: We exploited GIARPS at the TNG to
        acquire high-resolution, high-quality optical and near-IR
        spectra and derived stellar parameters, metallicity ([Fe/H]),
        light elements, {\ensuremath{\alpha}}- and iron-peak elements,
        by using a strictly differential (line-by-line) approach. We
        also analysed in the very same way the solar spectrum and the
        Hyades solar analogue HD 28099. <BR /> Results: Our findings
        suggest that Praesepe is more metal-rich than the Hyades, at the
        level of {\ensuremath{\Delta}}[Fe/H] = +0.05 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.01 dex, with a mean value of [Fe/H] = +0.21 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.01 dex. All the other elements scale with iron, as expected.
        This result seems to reject the hypothesis of a common origin
        for these two open clusters. Most importantly, Praesepe is
        currently the most metal-rich, young open cluster living in the
        solar neighbourhood. <P />Full Table 2 is only available at the

@article{Casamiquela2020,
	Abstract = {{Context. Well studied open clusters (OCs) of the solar neighborhood are
        frequently used as reference objects to test galactic and
        stellar theories. For that purpose, their chemical composition
        needs to be known with a high level of confidence. It is also
        important to clarify if each OC is chemically homogeneous and if
        it has a unique chemical signature. <BR /> Aims: The aims of
        this work are (1) to determine accurate and precise abundances
        of 22 chemical species (from Na to Eu) in the Hyades, Praesepe,
        and Rupecht 147 by using a large number of stars at different
        evolutionary states, (2) to evaluate the level of chemical
        homogeneity of these OCs, and (3) to compare their chemical
        signatures. <BR /> Methods: We gathered {\ensuremath{\sim}}800
        high resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}100 members in the three clusters, which were
        obtained with the latest memberships based on Gaia DR2 data. We
        built a pipeline, which computes atmospheric parameters and
        strictly line-by-line differential abundances among twin stars
        in our sample. With this method, we were able to reach a very
        high precision in the abundances (0.01-0.02 dex in most of the
        elements). <BR /> Results: We find large differences in the
        absolute abundances in some elements, which can be attributed to
        diffusion, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE)
        effects, or systematics in the analysis. For the three OCs, we
        find strong correlations in the differential abundances between
        different pairs of elements. According to our experiment with
        synthetic data, this can be explained by some level of chemical
        inhomogeneity. We compare differential abundances of several
        stars from the Hyades and Praesepe tails: The stars that differ
        more in chemical abundances also have distinct kinematics, even
        though they have been identified as members of the tail. <BR />
        Conclusions: It is possible to obtain high precision abundances
        using a differential analysis even when mixing spectra from
        different instruments. With this technique, we find that the
        Hyades and Preasepe have the same chemical signature when G
        dwarfs and K giants are considered. Despite a certain level of
        inhomogeneity in each cluster, it is still possible to clearly
        distinguish the chemical signature of the older cluster Ruprecht
        147 when compared to the Hyades and Praesepe. <P />Full Tables

        elemental abundances for 6 million stars from
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}8 million low-resolution (R
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1800) spectra from LAMOST DR5. This is based
        on a modeling approach that we dub the data-driven Payne (DD-
        Payne), which inherits essential ingredients from both the Payne
        and the Cannon. It is a data-driven model that incorporates
        constraints from theoretical spectral models to ensure the
        derived abundance estimates are physically sensible. Stars in
        LAMOST DR5 that are in common with either GALAH DR2 or APOGEE
        DR14 are used to train a model that delivers stellar parameters
        (T $_{eff}$, log g, V $_{mic}$) and abundances for 16 elements
        (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and
        Ba) over a metallicity range of {\ensuremath{-}}4 dex \&lt;
        [Fe/H] \&lt; 0.6 dex when applied to the LAMOST spectra. Cross-
        validation and repeat observations suggest that, for
        S/N$_{pixel}$ {\ensuremath{\geq}} 50, the typical internal
        abundance precision is 0.03─0.1 dex for the majority of these
        elements, with 0.2─0.3 dex for Cu and Ba, and the internal
        precision of T $_{eff}$ and log g is better than 30 K and 0.07
        dex, respectively. Abundance systematics at the
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.1 dex level are present in these estimates
        but are inherited from the high-resolution
        surveys{\textquoteright} training labels. For some elements,
        GALAH provides more robust training labels, for others, APOGEE.
        We provide flags to guide the quality of the label determination

        version of the abundance catalog is made publicly

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We aim to measure the metallicity distribution and velocity
        distribution of red giant branch (RGB) stars along the
        Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) streams. Thanks to the large
        number of stars of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sample,
        we can study the properties of streams as a function of the
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}$_{☉}$ from the Sgr core. <BR /> Methods:
        Using the 22 000 RGB stars from the ninth data release of SDSS,
        we selected 1100 RGB stars belonging to the streams of the Sgr.
        As compared with red horizontal branch stars (Shi et al. 2012,
        ApJ, 751, 130) the RGB stars constitute a large sample size and
        extend to a metal-poor component of [Fe/H] -3.0 dex. In
        particular, this RGB sample has a significant number of stars in
        the second wrap of the leading stream of the Sgr (leading arm
        2), and thus provides a good opportunity to understand the
        properties of the leading stream. <BR /> Results: We derive a
        metallicity gradient of -(2.3 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5)
        {\texttimes} 10$^{-3}$ dex deg$^{-1}$ in leading arm 2 for the
        first time, of -(1.6 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4) {\texttimes}

        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3) {\texttimes} 10$^{-3}$ dex deg$^{-1}$
        for the trailing arm 1. We check the distribution of Sgr stars
        in phase space and find a velocity dispersion of 21.5 km
        s$^{-1}$ for leading arm 1. Finally, we identify a possible new

	Abstract = {{Extracting accurate atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances from
        stellar spectra is crucial for studying the Galactic evolution.
        In this paper, a deep neural network architecture named StarNet
        is used to estimate stellar parameters (T $_{eff}$, log g,
        [M/H]), {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-elements as well as C and N
        abundances from LAMOST spectra, using stars in common with
        APOGEE survey as training data set. With the spectral signal-to-
        noise ratio (S/N) in g band (S/N$_{ g }$) larger than 10, the
        test indicates our method yields uncertainties of 45 K for T
        $_{eff}$, 0.1 dex for log g, 0.05 dex for [M/H], 0.03 dex for
        [{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/M], 0.06 dex for [C/M] and 0.07 dex for
        [N/M]. Because of few stars with [M/H] \&lt;-1.0 dex in the
        training set, the uncertainties are dominated by stars with
        [M/H] \&gt; -1.0 dex. Based on test results, we think StarNet is
        valid for measuring parameters from low-resolution spectra of
        the LAMOST survey. The trained network is then used to predict
        parameters for 938,720 giants from LAMOST DR5. Within the range
        of stellar parameters 4000 K \&lt; T $_{eff}$ \&lt; 5300 K, 0
        dex \&lt; log g \&lt; 3.8 dex and -2.5 dex \&lt; [M/H] \&lt; 0.5
        dex, the comparisons with high-precision measurements (e.g.,
        PASTEL, asteroseismic log g) yield uncertainties of 100 K for T
        $_{eff}$, 0.10 dex for log g, 0.12 dex for [M/H]. Our
        estimations are consistent with values from the high-precision
        measurements. In this research, a deep neural network is
        successfully applied on the numerous spectra from LAMOST. The
        deep neural network shows an excellent performance, which
        demonstrates that deep learning can effectively reduce the
        inconsistencies between parameters measured by the individual
        survey pipelines.}},

        Dimensions (HALO7D) data set consists of Keck II/DEIMOS
        spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope-measured proper motions
        of Milky Way halo main-sequence turnoff stars in the CANDELS
        fields. In this paper, the second in the HALO7D series, we
        present the proper motions for the HALO7D sample. We discuss our
        measurement methodology, which makes use of a Bayesian mixture
        modeling approach for creating the stationary reference frame of
        distant galaxies. Using the 3D kinematic HALO7D sample, we
        estimate the parameters of the halo velocity ellipsoid, \&lt;
        \{v\}$_{{\ensuremath{\varphi}} }$\&gt; ,\{{\ensuremath{\sigma}}
        \}$_{r}$,\{{\ensuremath{\sigma}} \}$_{{\ensuremath{\varphi}}
        }$,\{{\ensuremath{\sigma}} \}$_{{\ensuremath{\theta}} }$, and
        the velocity anisotropy {\ensuremath{\beta}}. Using the full
        HALO7D sample, we find {\ensuremath{\beta}}
        =\{0.68\}$_{-0.05}$$^{+0.04}$ at \&lt; r\&gt; =23 kpc. We also
        estimate the ellipsoid parameters for our sample split into
        three apparent magnitude bins; the posterior medians for these
        estimates of {\ensuremath{\beta}} are consistent with one
        another. Finally, we estimate {\ensuremath{\beta}} in each of
        the individual HALO7D fields. We find that the velocity
        anisotropy {\ensuremath{\beta}} can vary from field-to field,
        which suggests that the halo is not phase-mixed at \&lt; r\&gt;
        =23 \{kpc\}. We explore the {\ensuremath{\beta}} variation
        across the skies of two stellar halos from the Latte suite of
        FIRE-2 simulations, finding that both simulated galaxies show
        {\ensuremath{\beta}} variation over a range similar to that of
        the variation observed across the four HALO7D fields. The
        accretion histories of the two simulated galaxies result in
        different {\ensuremath{\beta}} variation patterns; spatially
        mapping {\ensuremath{\beta}} is thus a way forward in
        characterizing the accretion history of the Galaxy.}},

	Abstract = {{The determination of the Ba abundance in globular cluster (GC) stars is
        a very powerful test to address several issues in the framework
        of multiple population scenarios. We measured the Ba content for
        a sample of more than 1200 stars in 15 Galactic GCs, using high-
        resolution FLAMES/Giraffe spectra. We found no variation in
        [Ba/Fe] ratios for different stellar populations within each
        cluster; this means that low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars
        do not significantly contribute to the intracluster pollution.
        Very interestingly, we found that the fraction of Ba stars in
        first generation (FG) stars is close to the values derived for
        field stars (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2\%); on the other
        hand, second generation (SG) stars present a significantly lower
        fraction. An independent and successful test, based on radial
        velocity variations among giant stars in NGC 6121, confirms our
        finding: the binary fraction among FG stars is about
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde12\%, to be compared with
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1\% of SG stars. This is an
        evidence that SG stars formed in a denser environment, where
        infant mortality of binary systems was particularly efficient.

	Abstract = {{We have derived the mean proper motions and space velocities of 154
        Galactic globular clusters and the velocity dispersion profiles
        of 141 globular clusters based on a combination of Gaia DR2
        proper motions with ground-based line-of-sight velocities.
        Combining the velocity dispersion profiles derived here with new
        measurements of the internal mass functions allows us to model
        the internal kinematics of 144 clusters, more than 90 per cent
        of the currently known Galactic globular cluster population. We
        also derive the initial cluster masses by calculating the
        cluster orbits backwards in time applying suitable recipes to
        account for mass-loss and dynamical friction. We find a
        correlation between the stellar mass function of a globular
        cluster and the amount of mass lost from the cluster, pointing
        to dynamical evolution as one of the mechanisms shaping the mass
        function of stars in clusters. The mass functions also show
        strong evidence that globular clusters started with a bottom-
        light initial mass function. Our simulations show that the
        currently surviving globular cluster population has lost about
        80 per cent of its mass since the time of formation. If globular
        clusters started from a lognormal mass function, we estimate
        that the Milky Way contained about 500 globular clusters
        initially, with a combined mass of about 2.5 {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{8}$ M$_{☉}$. For a power-law initial mass function, the
        initial mass in globular clusters could have been a factor of
        three higher.}},

	Abstract = {{Our ability to model the shapes and strengths of iron lines in the solar
        spectrum is a critical test of the accuracy of the solar iron
        abundance, which sets the absolute zero-point of all stellar
        metallicities. We use an extensive 463-level Fe atom with new
        photoionization cross-sections for Fe I and quantum mechanical
        calculations of collisional excitation and charge transfer with
        neutral hydrogen; the latter effectively remove a free parameter
        that has hampered all previous line formation studies of Fe in
        non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE). For the first time,
        we use realistic 3D NLTE calculations of Fe for a quantitative
        comparison to solar observations. We confront our theoretical
        line profiles with observations taken at different viewing
        angles across the solar disc with the Swedish 1-m Solar
        Telescope. We find that 3D modelling well reproduces the
        observed centre-to-limb behaviour of spectral lines overall, but
        highlight aspects that may require further work, especially
        cross-sections for inelastic collisions with electrons. Our

	Abstract = {{Manganese (Mn) is a key Fe-group element, commonly employed in stellar
        population and nucleosynthesis studies to explore the role of SN
        Ia. We have developed a new non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
        (NLTE) model of Mn, including new photo-ionisation cross-
        sections and new transition rates caused by collisions with H
        and H$^{-}$ atoms. We applied the model in combination with one-
        dimensional (1D) LTE model atmospheres and 3D hydrodynamical
        simulations of stellar convection to quantify the impact of NLTE
        and convection on the line formation. We show that the effects
        of NLTE are present in Mn I and, to a lesser degree, in Mn II
        lines, and these increase with metallicity and with the
        effective temperature of a model. Employing 3D NLTE radiative
        transfer, we derive a new abundance of Mn in the Sun, A(Mn) =
        5.52 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 dex, consistent with the element
        abundance in C I meteorites. We also applied our methods to the
        analysis of three metal-poor benchmark stars. We find that 3D
        NLTE abundances are significantly higher than 1D LTE. For
        dwarfs, the differences between 1D NLTE and 3D NLTE abundances
        are typically within 0.15 dex, however, the effects are much
        larger in the atmospheres of giants owing to their more vigorous
        convection. We show that 3D NLTE successfully solves the
        ionisation and excitation balance for the RGB star HD 122563
        that cannot be achieved by 1D LTE or 1D NLTE modelling. For HD
        84937 and HD 140283, the ionisation balance is satisfied,
        however, the resonance Mn I triplet lines still show somewhat
        lower abundances compared to the high-excitation lines. Our
        results for the benchmark stars confirm that 1D LTE modelling
        leads to significant systematic biases in Mn abundances across
        the full wavelength range from the blue to the IR. We also
        produce a list of Mn lines that are not significantly biased by
        3D and can be reliably, within the 0.1 dex uncertainty, modelled
        in 1D NLTE. <P />The new cross-sections and rate coefficients

	Abstract = {{Context. The pursuit of more realistic spectroscopic modelling and
        consistent abundances has led us to begin a new series of papers
        designed to improve current solar and stellar abundances of
        various atomic species. To achieve this, we have begun updating
        the three-dimensional (3D) non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
        (non-LTE) radiative transfer code, MULTI3D, and the equivalent
        one-dimensional (1D) non-LTE radiative transfer code, MULTI 2.3.
        <BR /> Aims: We examine our improvements to these codes by
        redetermining the solar barium abundance. Barium was chosen for
        this test as it is an important diagnostic element of the
        s-process in the context of galactic chemical evolution. New Ba
        II + H collisional data for excitation and charge exchange
        reactions computed from first principles had recently become
        available and were included in the model atom. The atom also
        includes the effects of isotopic line shifts and hyperfine
        splitting. <BR /> Methods: A grid of 1D LTE barium lines were
        constructed with MULTI 2.3 and fit to the four Ba II lines
        available to us in the optical region of the solar spectrum.
        Abundance corrections were then determined in 1D non-LTE, 3D
        LTE, and 3D non-LTE. A new 3D non-LTE solar barium abundance was
        computed from these corrections. <BR /> Results: We present for
        the first time the full 3D non-LTE barium abundance of A(Ba) =
        2.27 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.01, which was
        derived from four individual fully consistent barium lines.

	Abstract = {{The O I 777 nm triplet is a key diagnostic of oxygen abundances in the
        atmospheres of FGK-type stars; however, it is sensitive to
        departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The
        accuracy of non-LTE line formation calculations has hitherto
        been limited by errors in the inelastic O+H collisional rate
        coefficients; several recent studies have used the Drawin
        recipe, albeit with a correction factor S$_{H}$ that is
        calibrated to the solar centre-to-limb variation of the triplet.
        We present a new model oxygen atom that incorporates inelastic
        O+H collisional rate coefficients using an asymptotic two-
        electron model based on linear combinations of atomic orbitals,
        combined with a free electron model based on the impulse
        approximation. Using a 3D hydrodynamic STAGGER model solar
        atmosphere and 3D non-LTE line formation calculations, we
        demonstrate that this physically motivated approach is able to
        reproduce the solar centre-to-limb variation of the triplet to
        0.02 dex, without any calibration of the inelastic collisional
        rate coefficients or other free parameters. We infer log
        {\ensuremath{\in}}$_{O}$ = 8.69 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 from the
        triplet alone, strengthening the case for a low solar oxygen

        Am stars. We also intend to check if chemical peculiarities and
        slow rotation can be explained by the presence of a weak
        magnetic field. <BR />Methods: We have obtained high resolution,
        high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of eight previously-
        classified Am stars, two normal A-type stars and one Blue
        Straggler, considered to be members of the Praesepe cluster. For
        all of these stars we have determined fundamental parameters and
        photospheric abundances for a large number of chemical elements,
        with a higher precision than was ever obtained before for this
        cluster. For seven of these stars we also obtained spectra in
        circular polarization and applied the LSD technique to constrain
        the longitudinal magnetic field. <BR />Results: No magnetic
        field was detected in any of the analysed stars. HD 73666, a
        Blue Straggler previously considered as an Ap (Si) star, turns
        out to have the abundances of a normal A-type star. Am
        classification is not confirmed for HD 72942. For HD 73709 we
        have also calculated synthetic {\ensuremath{\Delta}} a
        photometry that is in good agreement with the observations.
        There is a generally good agreement between abundance
        predictions of diffusion models and values that we have obtained
        for the remaining Am stars. However, the observed Na and S
        abundances deviate from the predictions by 0.6 dex and

        (\{{\ensuremath{\lesssim}} \} 0.2\{\{ per cent\}\}
        contamination) catalogue of wide binaries containing main-
        sequence (MS) and white dwarf (WD) components within 200 pc of
        the Sun. The public catalogue contains, after removal of
        clusters and resolved higher order multiples, \&gt; 50 000
        MS/MS, \&gt; 3000 WD/MS, and nearly 400 WD/WD binaries with
        projected separations of 50 {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} s/\{au\}
        \&lt; 50 000. Accounting for incompleteness and selection
        effects, we model the separation distribution of each class of
        binaries as a broken power law, revealing marked differences
        between the three populations. The separation distribution of
        MS/MS systems is nearly consistent with a single power law of
        slope -1.6 over at least 500 \&lt; s/au \&lt; 50 000, with
        marginal steepening at s \&gt; 10 000au. In contrast, the
        separation distributions of WD/MS and WD/WD binaries show
        distinct breaks at {\ensuremath{\sim}}3000 and
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}1500 au, respectively: they are flatter than
        the MS/MS distribution at small separations and steeper at large
        separations. Using binary population synthesis models, we show
        that these breaks are unlikely to be caused by external factors
        but can be explained if the WDs incur a kick of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.75 km s$^{-1}$ during their formation,
        presumably due to asymmetric mass-loss. The data rule out
        typical kick velocities above 2 km s$^{-1}$. Our results imply
        that most wide binaries with separations exceeding a few
        thousand au become unbound during post-MS evolution.}},

@article{CantatGaudin2020,
	Abstract = {{Context. Many of the open clusters listed in modern catalogues were
        initially reported by visual astronomers as apparent
        overdensities of bright stars. As observational techniques and
        analysis methods continue to improve, some of them have been
        shown to be chance alignments of stars and not true clusters.
        Recent publications making use of Gaia DR2 data have provided
        membership lists for over a thousand clusters, however, many
        nearby objects listed in the literature have so far evaded
        detection. <BR /> Aims: We aim to update the Gaia DR2 cluster
        census by performing membership determinations for known
        clusters that had been missed by previous studies and for
        recently-discovered clusters. We investigate a sub-set of non-
        detected clusters that, according to their literature
        parameters, should be easily visible in Gaia. Confirming or
        disproving the existence of old, inner-disc, high-altitude
        clusters is especially important as their survival or disruption
        is linked to the dynamical processes that drive the evolution of
        the Milky Way. <BR /> Methods: We employed the Gaia DR2
        catalogue and a membership assignment procedure, as well as
        visual inspections of spatial, proper motion, and parallax
        distributions. We used membership lists provided by other
        authors when available. <BR /> Results: We derived membership
        lists for 150 objects, including ten that were already known
        prior to Gaia. We compiled a final list of members for 1481
        clusters. Among the objects that we are still unable to identify
        with the Gaia data, we argue that many (mostly putatively old,
        relatively nearby, high-altitude objects) are not true clusters.
        <BR /> Conclusions: At present, the only confirmed cluster
        located further than 500 pc away from the Galactic plane within
        the Solar circle is NGC 6791. It is likely that the objects
        discussed in this study only represent a fraction of the non-
        physical groupings erroneously listed in the catalogues as
        genuine open clusters and that those lists need further
        cleaning. <P />Full Table 1 and the list of individual members
        are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=``htt

	Abstract = {The scaling relations for solar-like oscillations provide a translation of the features of the stochastic low-degree modes of oscillation in the Sun to predict the features of solar-like oscillations in other stars with convective outer layers. This prediction is based on their stellar mass, radius, and effective temperature. Over time, the original scaling relations have been reversed in their use from predicting features of solar-like oscillations to deriving stellar parameters. Updates to the scaling relations as well as their reference values have been proposed to accommodate for the different requirements set by the change in their use. In this review the suggestions for improving the accuracy of the estimates of stellar parameters through the scaling relations for solar-like oscillations are presented together with a discussion of pros and cons of different approaches.},

        WEAVE will provide optical ground-based follow up of ground-
        based (LOFAR) and space-based (Gaia) surveys. WEAVE is a multi-
        object and multi-IFU facility utilizing a new 2-degree prime
        focus field of view at the WHT, with a buffered pick-and-place
        positioner system hosting 1000 multi-object (MOS) fibres, 20
        integral field units, or a single large IFU for each
        observation. The fibres are fed to a single (dual-beam)
        spectrograph, with total of 16k spectral pixels, located within
        the WHT GHRIL enclosure on the telescope Nasmyth platform,
        supporting observations at R 5000 over the full 370-1000nm
        wavelength range in a single exposure, or a high resolution mode

	Abstract = {{High-precision spectroscopy of large stellar samples plays a crucial
        role for several topical issues in astrophysics, such as
        studying the chemical evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy. Data
        are accumulating from instruments that obtain high-quality
        spectra of stars in the ultraviolet, optical and infrared
        wavelength regions on a routine basis. The interpretation of
        these spectra is often based on synthetic stellar spectra,
        either calculated on the fly or taken from a spectral library.
        One of the most important ingredients of these spectra is a set
        of high-quality transition data for numerous species, in
        particular neutral and singly ionized atoms. We rely heavily on
        the continuous activities of laboratory astrophysics groups that
        produce and improve the relevant experimental and theoretical
        atomic data. As an example, we briefly describe the efforts done
        in the context of the Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey to
        compile and assess the best available data in a standard way,
        providing a list of recommended lines for analysis of optical
        spectra of FGK stars. The line data, together with specialised
        analysis methods, allow different surveys to obtain abundances
        with typical precisions of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.1
        dex on an industrial scale for
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10 chemical elements. Several
        elements with urgent need for better atomic data have been
        identified.}},

	Abstract = {{We show that the inclusion of special relativistic corrections in the
        revised OPAL and MHD equations of state has a significant impact
        on the helioseismic determination of the solar age. Models with
        relativistic corrections included lead to a reduction of about
        0.05-0.08 ; Gyr with respect to those obtained with the old OPAL
        or MHD EOS. Our best-fit value is t$_{seis}$ = (4.57 +/- 0.11) ;
        Gyr which is in remarkably good agreement with the meteoritic
        value for the solar age. We argue that the inclusion of
        relativistic corrections is important for probing the
        evolutionary state of a star by means of the small frequency

	Abstract = {{We use Gaia Data Release 2 to determine the mean proper motions for 150
        Milky Way globular clusters (almost the entire known
        population), with a typical uncertainty of 0.05 mas yr$^{-1}$
        limited mainly by systematic errors. Combining them with
        distance and line-of-sight velocity measurements from the
        literature, we analyse the distribution of globular clusters in
        the 6D phase space, using both position/velocity and
        action/angle coordinates. The population of clusters in the
        central 10 kpc has a mean rotational velocity reaching 50-80 km
        s$^{-1}$ , and a nearly isotropic velocity dispersion 100-120 km
        s$^{-1}$ , while in the outer galaxy, the cluster orbits are
        strongly radially anisotropic. We confirm a concentration of
        clusters at high radial action in the outer region of the
        Galaxy. Finally, we explore a range of equilibrium distribution
        function-based models for the entire globular cluster system,
        and the information they provide about the potential of the
        Milky Way. The dynamics of clusters is best described by models
        with the circular velocity between 10 and 50 kpc staying in the
        range 210-240 km s$^{-1}$.}},

	Abstract = {{Aims: We study how chemical abundances of late B-, A-, and early F-type
        stars evolve with time, and we search for correlations between
        the abundance of chemical elements and other stellar parameters,
        such as effective temperature and {\ensuremath{\upsilon}} sin i.
        <BR />Methods: We observed a large number of B-, A-, and F-type
        stars belonging to open clusters of different ages. In this
        paper we concentrate on the Praesepe cluster (log t = 8.85), for
        which we have obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise
        ratio spectra of sixteen normal A- and F-type stars and one Am
        star, using the SOPHIE spectrograph of the Observatoire de
        Haute-Provence. For all the observed stars, we derived
        fundamental parameters and chemical abundances. In addition, we
        discuss another eight Am stars belonging to the same cluster,
        for which the abundance analysis had been presented in a
        previous paper. <BR />Results: We find a strong correlation
        between the peculiarity of Am stars and {\ensuremath{\upsilon}}
        sin i. The abundance of the elements underabundant in Am stars
        increases with {\ensuremath{\upsilon}} sin i, while it decreases
        for the overabundant elements. Chemical abundances of various
        elements appear correlated with the iron abundance. <P />Based

	Abstract = {{One of the high-level goals of Galactic archaeology is chemical tagging
        of stars across the Milky Way to piece together its assembly
        history. For this to work, stars born together must be uniquely
        chemically homogeneous. Wide binary systems are an important
        laboratory to test this underlying assumption. Here, we present
        the detailed chemical abundance patterns of 50 stars across 25
        wide binary systems comprised of main-sequence stars of similar
        spectral type identified in Gaia DR2 with the aim of quantifying
        their level of chemical homogeneity. Using high-resolution
        spectra obtained with McDonald Observatory, we derive stellar
        atmospheric parameters and precise detailed chemical abundances
        for light/odd-Z (Li, C, Na, Al, Sc, V, Cu),
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}} (Mg, Si, Ca), Fe-peak (Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
        Ni, Zn), and neutron capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu)
        elements. Results indicate that 80 per cent (20 pairs) of the
        systems are homogeneous in [Fe/H] at levels below 0.02 dex.
        These systems are also chemically homogeneous in all elemental
        abundances studied, with offsets and dispersions consistent with
        measurement uncertainties. We also find that wide binary systems
        are far more chemically homogeneous than random pairings of
        field stars of similar spectral type. These results indicate
        that wide binary systems tend to be chemically homogeneous but
        in some cases they can differ in their detailed elemental
        abundances at a level of [X/H] ̃ 0.10 dex, overall implying
        chemical tagging in broad strokes can work.}},

@article{Kos2018d,
	Abstract = {{Context. The Orion complex is arguably the most studied star-forming
        region in the Galaxy. While stars are still being born in the
        Orion nebula, the oldest part was believed to be no more than 13
        Myr old. <BR /> Aims: In order to study the full hierarchy of
        star formation across the Orion complex, we perform a clustering
        analysis of the Ori OB1a region using new stellar surveys and
        derive robust ages for each identified stellar aggregate. <BR />
        Methods: We use Gaia DR2 parameters supplemented with radial
        velocities from the GALAH and APOGEE surveys to perform
        clustering of the Ori OB1a association. Five overdensities are
        resolved in a six-dimensional parameter space (positions,
        distance, proper motions, and radial velocity). Most correspond
        to previously known structures (ASCC 16, 25 Orionis, ASCC 20,
        ASCC 21). We use Gaia DR2, Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS photometry to
        fit isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams of the
        identified clusters. The ages of the clusters can thus be
        measured with ̃10\% precision. <BR /> Results: While four of the
        clusters have ages between 11 and 13 Myr, the ASCC 20 cluster
        stands out at an age of 21 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3 Myr. This is
        significantly greater than the age of any previously known
        component of the Orion complex. To some degree, all clusters
        overlap in at least one of the six phase-space dimensions. <BR
        /> Conclusions: We argue that the formation history of the Orion
        complex, and its relation to the Gould belt, must be
        reconsidered. A significant challenge in reconstructing the
        history of the Ori OB1a association is to understand the impact
        of the newly discovered 21 Myr old population on the younger
        parts of the complex, including their formation. <P />Movie

        resolution echelle spectrometer. Published radiative lifetimes
        from laser induced fluorescence measurements are combined with
        the branching fractions to determine accurate absolute atomic
        transition probabilities for the 898 lines. Hyperfine structure
        (hfs) constants for levels of neutral Co in the literature are
        surveyed and selected values are used to generate complete hfs
        component patterns for 195 transitions of Co i. These new
        laboratory data are applied to determine the Co abundance in the

        and ``forbidden'' (magnetic dipole plus electric and magnetic
        quadrupole) transitions. In each spectrum, lines are grouped
        into multiplets which are arranged in order of ascending lower-

	Abstract = {{Stellar ages are a crucial component to studying the evolution of the
        Milky Way. Using Gaia DR2 distance estimates, it is now possible
        to estimate stellar ages for a larger volume of evolved stars
        through isochrone matching. This work presents [M/H]-age and
        [{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/M]-age relations derived for different
        spatial locations in the Milky Way disc. These relations are
        derived by hierarchically modelling the star formation history
        of stars within a given chemical abundance bin. For the first
        time, we directly observe that significant variation is apparent
        in the [M/H]-age relation as a function of both Galactocentric
        radius and distance from the disc mid-plane. The [M/H]-age
        relations support claims that radial migration has a significant
        effect in the plane of the disc. Using the [M/H] bin with the
        youngest mean age at each radial zone in the plane of the disc,
        the present-day metallicity gradient is measured to be -0.059
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.010 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in agreement with
        Cepheids and young field stars. We find a vertically flared
        distribution of young stars in the outer disc, confirming
        predictions of models and previous observations. The mean age of
        the [M/H]-[{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/M] distribution of the solar
        neighbourhood suggests that the high-[M/H] stars are not an
        evolutionary extension of the low-{\ensuremath{\alpha}}
        sequence. Our observational results are important constraints to
        Galactic simulations and models of chemical evolution.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. In several instances chemical abundances of main-sequence and
        giant stars are used simultaneously under the assumption that
        they share the same abundance scale. This assumption, if wrong,
        might have important implications in different astrophysical
        contexts. <BR /> Aims: It is therefore crucial to understand
        whether the metallicity or abundance differences among dwarfs
        and giants are real or are produced by systematic errors in the
        analysis. We aim to ascertain a methodology capable of producing
        a consistent metallicity scale for giants and dwarfs. <BR />
        Methods: To achieve that, we analyzed giants and dwarfs in the
        Hyades open cluster, under the assumption that they share the
        same chemical composition. All the stars in this cluster have
        archival high-resolution spectroscopic data obtained with HARPS
        and UVES. In addition, the giants have interferometric
        measurements of the angular diameters. We analyzed the sample
        with two methods. The first method constrains the atmospheric
        parameters independently from spectroscopic method. For that we
        present a novel calibration of microturbulence based on 3D model
        atmospheres. The second method is the classical spectroscopic
        analysis based on Fe lines. We also tested two different line
        lists in an attempt to minimize possible non-LTE effects and to
        optimize the treatment of the giants. <BR /> Results: We show
        that it is possible to obtain a consistent metallicity scale
        between dwarfs and giants. The preferred method should constrain
        the three parameters T$_{eff}$, log g, and {\ensuremath{\xi}}
        independent of spectroscopy. A careful selection of Fe lines is
        also important. In particular, the lines should not be chosen
        based on the Sun or other dwarfs, but specifically to be free of
        blends in the spectra of giants. When attention is paid to the
        line list, the classical spectroscopic method can also produce
        consistent results. In our test, the metallicities derived with
        the well-constrained set of stellar parameters are consistent
        independent of the line list used. Therefore, for this cluster
        we favor the metallicity of +0.18 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 dex
        obtained with this method. The classical spectroscopic analysis,
        using the line list optimized for the giants, provides a
        metallicity of +0.14 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 dex, in agreement
        with previous works. <P />Based on data obtained from the ESO

	Abstract = {{We present The Payne, a general method for the precise and simultaneous
        determination of numerous stellar labels from observed spectra,
        based on fitting physical spectral models. The Payne combines a
        number of important methodological aspects: it exploits the
        information from much of the available spectral range; it fits
        all labels (stellar parameters and elemental abundances)
        simultaneously; it uses spectral models, where the structure of
        the atmosphere and the radiative transport are consistently
        calculated to reflect the stellar labels. At its core The Payne
        has an approach to accurate and precise interpolation and
        prediction of the spectrum in high-dimensional label space that
        is flexible and robust, yet based on only a moderate number of
        ab initio models (\{ \textbackslashmathcal O \}(1000) for 25
        labels). With a simple neural-net-like functional form and a
        suitable choice of training labels, this interpolation yields a
        spectral flux prediction good to 10$^{-3}$ rms across a wide
        range of T $_{eff}$ and \{log\}g (including dwarfs and giants).
        We illustrate the power of this approach by applying it to the
        APOGEE DR14 data set, drawing on Kurucz models with recently
        improved line lists: without recalibration, we obtain physically
        sensible stellar parameters as well as 15 elemental abundances
        that appear to be more precise than the published APOGEE DR14
        values. In short, The Payne is an approach that for the first
        time combines all these key ingredients, necessary for progress
        toward optimal modeling of survey spectra; and it leads to both
        precise and accurate estimates of stellar labels, based on
        physical models and without
        {\textquotedblleft}recalibration.{\textquotedblright} Both the
        codes and catalog are made publicly available online.}},

	Abstract = {{Historically, it has often been asserted that most stars form in compact
clusters. In this scenario, present-day gravitationally-unbound OB
associations are the result of the expansion of initially
gravitationally-bound star clusters. However, this paradigm is
inconsistent with recent results, both theoretical and observational,
that instead favour a hierarchical picture of star formation in which
stars are formed across a continuous distribution of gas densities and
most OB associations never were bound clusters. Instead they are formed
in-situ as the low-density side of this distribution, rather than as the
remnants of expanding clusters. We utilise the second $Gaia$ data
release to quantify the degree to which OB associations are undergoing
expansion and, therefore, whether OB associations are the product of
expanding clusters, or whether they were born in-situ, as the
large-scale, globally-unbound associations that we see today. We find
that the observed kinematic properties of associations are consistent
with highly substructured velocity fields and additionally require some
degree of localised expansion from sub-clusters within the association.
While most present-day OB associations do exhibit low levels of
expansion, there is no significant correlation between radial velocity
and radius. Therefore, the large-scale structure of associations is not
set by the expansion of clusters, rather it is a relic of the molecular
gas cloud from which the association was formed. This finding is
inconsistent with a monolithic model of association formation and
instead favours a hierarchical model, in which OB associations form
in-situ, following the fractal structure of the gas from which they
form.

	Abstract = {{Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength
imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy
formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary
techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the
cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and
reionization of the Universe from the cosmic {\ldquo}dark ages{\rdquo} to
the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the
star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big
Bang, at z{\ap}1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an
e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today
was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak
of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after
z = 0.7. Less than {\tilde}1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of
reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function,
the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably
well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The
comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow
a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black
holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the
Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang,
appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten
hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for
cosmological reionization.

	Abstract = {{We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final
nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, in
conjunction with a number of additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP
data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a
six-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM model. When WMAP data are combined with
measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the
baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter
and energy densities, {$\Omega$}$_{ b }$ h $^{2}$, {$\Omega$}$_{
c }$ h $^{2}$, and {$\Omega$}$_{Lambda}$, are each
determined to a precision of \~{}1.5\%. The amplitude of the primordial
spectrum is measured to within 3\%, and there is now evidence for a tilt
in the primordial spectrum at the 5{$\sigma$} level, confirming the first
detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the
WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the
six-dimensional {$\Lambda$}CDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000
relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data
combinations and show that their {$\Lambda$}CDM parameter fits are
consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are
presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is
limited to r $\lt$ 0.13 (95\% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is
limited to $\backslash$Omega \_k = -0.0027\^{}$\{$+ 0.0039$\}$\_$\{$- 0.0038$\}$; the summed mass of
neutrinos is limited to {\sum}m $_{nu}$ $\lt$ 0.44 eV (95\% CL);
and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N
$_{eff}$ = 3.84 {\plusmn} 0.40, when the full data are analyzed.
The joint constraint on N $_{eff}$ and the primordial helium
abundance, Y $_{He}$, agrees with the prediction of standard big
bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show
their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around
temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction
of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration
of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early
universe.

assuming [Ca/Fe] {\ge} 0.40. The chemical abundance pattern of
J0023+0307, with very low [Fe/Mg] and [Ca/Mg] abundance ratios but
relatively high absolute Mg and Si abundances, suggests J0023+0307 is a
second generation star formed from a molecular cloud polluted by only
one supernova in which the fallback mechanism played a role. We measure
a carbon abundance of A(C) = 6.2 that places J0023+0307 on the low band
in the A(C)-[Fe/H] diagram, suggesting no contamination from a
binary companion. This star is also unique having a lithium abundance
A(Li) = 2.02 {\plusmn} 0.08, close to the level of the lithium plateau,
in contrast with lower Li determinations or upper limits in all other
extremely iron-poor stars. The upper envelope of the lithium abundances
in unevolved stars spanning more than three orders of magnitude in
metallicity (-6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -2.5) defines a nearly
constant value. We argue that it is unlikely that such uniformity is the
result of depletion processes in stars from a significantly higher
initial Li abundance, but suggests instead a lower primordial
production, pointing to new physics such as decaying massive particles,
varying fundamental constants, or nuclear resonances, that could have
affected the primordial $^{7}$Li production.

	Abstract = {{The lowest luminosity (L $\lt$ 10\^{}5 L\_sun) Milky Way satellite galaxies
represent the extreme lower limit of the galaxy luminosity function.
These ultra-faint dwarfs are the oldest, most dark matter-dominated,
most metal-poor, and least chemically evolved stellar systems known.
They therefore provide unique windows into the formation of the first
galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on small scales. In this
review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey in 2005, and the subsequent observational and
theoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We
describe their stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns,
structural properties, stellar populations, orbits, and luminosity
function, and what can be learned from each type of measurement. We
conclude that: (1) in most cases, the stellar velocity dispersions of
ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic uncertainties such as
binary stars and foreground contamination; (2) the chemical abundance
patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources of r-process
elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star mergers;
(3) even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of
ultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of
their stellar components; (4) determining the properties of the faintest
dwarfs out to the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large
investments of observing time with future telescopes. Finally, we offer
a look forward at the observations that will be possible with future
facilities as the push toward a complete census of the Local Group dwarf
galaxy population continues.

conflicting results concerning the vertical characteristics of the Milky
Way. Ages are often used to provide clarity, but typical uncertainties
of $\gt$ 40$\backslash$,$\backslash$\% restrict the validity of the inferences made. Using the
$\backslash$textit$\{$Kepler$\}$ APOKASC sample for context, we explore the global
population trends of two K2 campaign fields (3 and 6), which extend
further vertically out of the Galactic plane than APOKASC. We analyse
the properties of red giant stars utilising three asteroseismic data
analysis methods to cross-check and validate detections. The Bayesian
inference tool PARAM is used to determine the stellar masses, radii and
ages. Evidence of a pronounced red giant branch bump and an
[$\alpha$/Fe] dependence on the position of the red clump is observed
from the radii distribution of the K2 fields. Two peaks in the age
distribution centred at $\sim$5 and and $\sim$12 Gyr are found using a
sample with $\sigma\_{\rm{age}}$ $\lt$ 35$\backslash$,$\backslash$\%. In a comparison with
$\backslash$textit$\{$Kepler$\}$, we find the older peak to be more prominent for K2.
This age bimodality is also observed based on a chemical selection of
low- ($\leq$ 0.1) and high- ($\gt$ 0.1) [$\alpha$/Fe] stars. As a
function of vertical distance from the Galactic mid-plane ($|Z|$), the
age distribution shows a transition from a young to old stellar
population with increasing $|Z|$ for the K2 fields. Further coverage of
campaign targets with high resolution spectroscopy is required to
increase the yield of precise ages achievable with asteroseismology.

	Abstract = {{In the era of large-scale surveys of stars in the Milky Way, stellar
ages are crucial for studying the evolution of the Galaxy. But
determining ages of field stars is notoriously difficult; therefore, we
attempt to determine benchmark ages for the extensively studied Gaia
benchmark stars which can be used for validation purposes. By searching
the literature for age estimates from different methods and deriving new
ages based on Bayesian isochrone fitting, we are able to put reliable
limits on the ages of 16 out of the 33 benchmark stars. The giants with
well-defined ages are all young, and an expansion of the sample to
include older giants with asteroseismic ages would be beneficial. Some
of the stars have surface parameters inconsistent with isochrones
younger than 16 Gyr. Including {$\alpha$}-enhancement in the models when
relevant resolves some of these cases, but others clearly highlight
discrepancies between the models and observations. We test the impact of
atomic diffusion on the age estimates by fitting to the actual surface
metallicity of the models instead of the initial value and find that the
effect is negligible except for a single turn-off star. Finally, we show
that our ability to determine isochrone-based ages for large
spectroscopic surveys largely mirrors our ability to determine ages for
these benchmark stars, except for stars with log g {\gsim} 4.4 dex since
their location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is almost age
insensitive. Hence, isochrone fitting does not constrain their ages
given the typical uncertainties of spectroscopic stellar parameters.

	Abstract = {{We present and apply a method to infer the mass of the Milky Way (MW) by
comparing the dynamics of MW satellites to those of model satellites in
the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. A distribution
function (DF) for galactic satellites is constructed from EAGLE using
specific angular momentum and specific energy, which are scaled so as to
be independent of host halo mass. In this two-dimensional space, the
orbital properties of satellite galaxies vary according to the host halo
mass. The halo mass can be inferred by calculating the likelihood that
the observed satellite population is drawn from this DF. Our method is
robustly calibrated on mock EAGLE systems. We validate it by applying it
to the completely independent suite of 30 AURIGA high-resolution
simulations of MW-like galaxies: the method accurately recovers their
true mass and associated uncertainties. We then apply it to 10 classical
satellites of the MW with six-dimensional phase-space measurements,
including updated proper motions from the Gaia satellite. The mass of
the MW is estimated to be M\_$\{$200$\}$\^{}$\{$MW$\}$=1.17\_$\{$-0.15$\}$\^{}$\{$+0.21$\}${\times}
10\^{}$\{$12$\}$ M\_$\{${\sun}$\}$ (68 per cent confidence limits). We combine our total

	Abstract = {{Studies of the ages, abundances, and motions of individual stars in the
Milky Way provide one of the best ways to study the evolution of disk
galaxies over cosmic time. The formation of the Milky Way's barred inner
region in particular is a crucial piece of the puzzle of disk galaxy
evolution. Using data from APOGEE and Gaia, we present maps of the
kinematics, elemental abundances, and age of the Milky Way bulge and
disk that show the barred structure of the inner Milky Way in
unprecedented detail. The kinematic maps allow a direct, purely
kinematic determination of the bar's pattern speed of 41+/-3 km/s/kpc
and of its shape and radial profile. We find the bar's age, metallicity,
and abundance ratios to be the same as those of the oldest stars in the
disk that are formed in its turbulent beginnings, while stars in the
bulge outside of the bar are younger and more metal-rich. This implies
that the bar likely formed \~{}8 Gyr ago, when the decrease in turbulence
in the gas disk allowed a thin disk to form that quickly became
bar-unstable. The bar's formation therefore stands as a crucial epoch in
the evolution of the Milky Way, a picture that is in line with the
evolutionary path that emerges from observations of the gas kinematics
in external disk galaxies over the last \~{}10 Gyr.

hundreds of millions of stars. Yet they will not measure a single
distance. Rather, a distance must be estimated from a parallax. In this
didactic article, I show that doing this is not trivial once the
fractional parallax error is larger than about 20\%, which will be the
case for about 80\% of stars in the Gaia catalogue. Estimating distances
is an inference problem in which the use of prior assumptions is
unavoidable. I investigate the properties and performance of various
priors and examine their implications. A supposed uninformative uniform
prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance estimates (large
bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some distance has
similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information one has
available - and is willing to use - concerning, for example, the survey
and the Galaxy. I demonstrate that a simple prior which decreases
asymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance,
accommodates non-positive parallaxes, and does not require a bias
correction.

distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct
inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity
of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability
distribution. Here, we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion
stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is
done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of
Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The
irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the
lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although
more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using
additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely
geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the
physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual

	Abstract = {{The information on the chemical compositions of stars encoded in their
spectra plays a central role in contemporary astrophysics. Stellar
element abundances are, however, not observed: to decipher the spectral
fingerprints in terms of abundances requires realistic models for the
stellar atmospheres and the line-formation processes. Still today, the
vast majority of abundance analyses of late-type stars rely on
one-dimensional (1D), hydrostatic model atmospheres and the assumption
of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In this review possible
systematic errors in studies of F-, G- and K-type stars introduced by
these questionable approximations are discussed. Departures from LTE are
commonplace and often quite severe, in particular for low surface
gravities or metallicities, with minority species and low-excitation
transitions being the most vulnerable. Recently, time-dependent, 3D,
hydrodynamical model atmospheres have started to be employed for stellar
abundance purposes, with large differences compared with 1D modeling
found in particular for metal-poor stars. An assessment of non-LTE and
3D effects for individual elements as well as on the estimated stellar
parameters is presented.

	Abstract = {{We introduce a suite of 30 cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical zoom
simulations of the formation of galaxies in isolated Milky Way mass dark
haloes. These were carried out with the moving mesh code arepo, together
with a comprehensive model for galaxy formation physics, including
active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and magnetic fields, which
produces realistic galaxy populations in large cosmological simulations.
We demonstrate that our simulations reproduce a wide range of
present-day observables, in particular, two-component disc-dominated
galaxies with appropriate stellar masses, sizes, rotation curves, star
formation rates and metallicities. We investigate the driving mechanisms
that set present-day disc sizes/scalelengths, and find that they are
related to the angular momentum of halo material. We show that the
largest discs are produced by quiescent mergers that inspiral into the
galaxy and deposit high-angular momentum material into the pre-existing
disc, simultaneously increasing the spin of dark matter and gas in the
halo. More violent mergers and strong AGN feedback play roles in
limiting disc size by destroying pre-existing discs and by suppressing
gas accretion on to the outer disc, respectively. The most important
factor that leads to compact discs, however, is simply a low angular
momentum for the halo. In these cases, AGN feedback plays an important
role in limiting central star formation and the formation of a massive
bulge.

	Abstract = {{Gaia DR2 has revealed new small-scale and large-scale patterns in the
phase space distribution of stars in the Milky Way. In particular,
ridge-like structures can be seen in the (R,Vphi) plane and asymmetric
arch-like structures in the (Vphi,VR) plane. We show that the ridges are
also clearly present when the third dimension of the (R,Vphi) plane is
represented by $\lt$z$\gt$, $\lt$V\_z$\gt$, $\lt$V\_R$\gt$, $\lt$[Fe/H]$\gt$ and
$\lt$[alpha/Fe]$\gt$. The maps suggest that stars along the ridges lie
preferentially close to the Galactic midplane (|z|$\lt$0.2 kpc), and have
metallicity and alpha elemental abundance similar to that of the Sun. We
show that phase mixing of disrupting spiral arms can generate both the
ridges and the arches. It also generates discrete groupings in orbital
energy - the ridges and arches are simply surfaces of constant energy.
We identify 8 distinct ridges in the Gaia DR2 data: six of them have
constant energy while two have constant angular momentum. Given that the
signature is strongest for stars close to the plane, the presence of
ridges in $\lt$z$\gt$ and $\lt$V\_z$\gt$ suggests a coupling between planar
and vertical directions. We demonstrate using N-body simulations that
such coupling can be generated both in isolated discs and in discs
perturbed by an orbiting satellite like the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.

	Abstract = {{The stellar populations in the inner kiloparsecs of the Milky Way (MW)
show complex kinematical and chemical structures. The origin and
evolution of these structures are still under debate. Here we study the
central region of a fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of a
disk galaxy that reproduces key properties of the inner kiloparsecs of
the MW: it has a boxy morphology and shows an overall rotation and
dispersion profile in agreement with observations. We use a clustering
algorithm on stellar kinematics to identify a number of discrete
kinematic components: a high- and low-spin disk, a stellar halo, and two
bulge components, one fast-rotating and one slow-rotating. We focus on
the two bulge components and show that the slow-rotating one is
spherically symmetric while the fast-rotating component shows a
boxy/peanut morphology. Although the two bulge components are
kinematically discrete populations at present day, they are both mostly
formed over similar timescales, from disk material. We find that stellar
particles with lower initial birth angular momentum (most likely
thick-disk stars) end up in the slow-rotating low-spin bulge, while
stars with higher birth angular momentum (most likely thin-disk stars)
are found in the high-spin bulge. This has the important consequence
that a bulge population with a spheroidal morphology does not
necessarily indicate a merger origin. In fact, we do find that only
{\sim}2.3\% of the stars in the bulge components are ex situ stars brought
in by accreted dwarf galaxies early on. We identify these ex situ stars
as the oldest and most metal-poor stars on highly radial orbits with
large vertical excursions from the disk.

evolution of galaxies in cosmological, large-scale
gravity+magnetohydrodynamical simulations with the moving mesh code
AREPO. The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris
galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation,
stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line
cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black
hole formation, growth and multimode feedback. In this paper, we give a
comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances that
form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework. We
focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we
modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content and energy
scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described
in earlier works, the model also includes a new black-hole-driven
kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics and
improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc
h$^{-1}$)$^{3}$ cosmological boxes, we assess the outcome of
the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a
self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important
impact on the stellar content of 10$^{12}$ M$_{&sun;}$
haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds
promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching
observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of
the low-mass end of the galaxy population.

	Abstract = {{We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies
and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical
simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black
holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard {$\Lambda$}
cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such
simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained
subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major
improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas
without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces,
allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading
factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from
first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar
mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass
relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy
stellar mass function is reproduced to {\lsim} 0.2 dex over the full
resolved mass range, 10$^{8}$ $\lt$ M$_{*}$/M$_{&sun;}$
{\lsim} 10$^{11}$, a level of agreement close to that attained by
semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations.
We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift
observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement
with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive
fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy
clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O
VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are
consistent with observations for M$_{*}$ {\gsim} 10$^{9}$
M$_{&sun;}$ (M$_{*}$ {\gsim} 10$^{10}$
M$_{&sun;}$ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently
steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and
temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy
groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating
temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE
simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher
resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable
new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

	Abstract = {{We present results from 13 cosmological simulations that explore the
parameter space of the `Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their
Environments' (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow
the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs
a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star
formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations
each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1.
Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as
observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of
numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar
feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the
fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy
in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed
size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In
the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the
reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of
galaxies with stellar mass {\lsim} M$^{*}$ (the `knee' of the
galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback
associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are
also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black
holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the
observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been
calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function
will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement
that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of
observables.

includes giants mostly within \~{}5 kpc from the Galactic disks and halo.
The nearby halo is found to (1) exhibit significant kinematical

coherent structures, including a very retrograde ``cloud'' of stars at l \~{}
285{\deg} and extended, retrograde ``streams'' visible as relatively tight
l-v$_{b}$ sequences. One sequence in the fourth Galactic quadrant
lies within the l-v$_{b}$ space expected to contain tidal debris
from the ``star cluster'' {$\omega$}Centauri. Not only does {$\omega$}Cen lie
precisely in this l-v$_{b}$ sequence, but the positions and
v$_{b}$ of member stars match those of N-body simulations of
tidally disrupting dwarf galaxies on orbits ending with {$\omega$}Cen's
current position and space motion. But the ultimate proof that we have
very likely found extended parts of the {$\omega$}Cen tidal stream comes
from echelle spectroscopy of a subsample of the stars that reveals a
very particular chemical abundance signature known to occur only in
{$\omega$}Cen. The newly discovered {$\omega$}Cen debris accounts for almost
all fourth Galactic quadrant retrograde stars in the southern GGSS,
which suggests {$\omega$}Cen is a dominant contributor of retrograde giant
stars in the inner Galaxy.

a new photometric calibration for M$_{v}$ also based on the
Hipparcos parallaxes, provide distances for nearly all of these stars;
our previous photometric calibrations give values for E(b-y) and [Fe/H].
The [Fe/H], V(rot) diagram allows us to separate these stars into
different Galactic stellar population groups, such as old-thin-disk,
thick-disk, and halo. The X histogram, where X is our stellar-population
discriminator combining V(rot) and [Fe/H], and contour plots for the
[Fe/H], V(rot) diagram both indicate two probable components to the
thick disk. These population groups and Galactic components are studied
in the (b-y)$_{0}$, M$_{v}$ diagram, compared to the
isochrones of Bergbusch {\amp} VandenBerg (2001, ApJ, 556, 322), to
derive stellar ages. The two thick-disk groups have the mean
characteristics: ([Fe/H], V(rot), Age, {$\sigma$}$_{W'}$) {\ap} (-0.7
dex, 120 km s$^{-1}$, 12.5 Gyr, 62.0 km s$^{-1}$), and

-2.31 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le} -1.31, show a mean age of 13.0 {\plusmn} 0.2 (mean

of the Universe of 0.7 {\plusmn} 0.3 Gyr. These results for the ages and

	Abstract = {{If the Galaxy is axisymmetric and in dynamical equilibrium, we expect
negligible fluctuations in the residual line-of-sight velocity field.
Recent results using the APOGEE survey find significant fluctuations in
velocity for stars in the mid-plane (|z| $\lt$0.25 kpc) out to 5 kpc,
suggesting that the dynamical influence of non-axisymmetric features,
i.e. the Milky Way's bar, spiral arms, and merger events extends out to
the Solar neighbourhood. Their measured power spectrum has a
characteristic amplitude of 11 km s$^{-1}$ on a scale of 2.5 kpc.
The existence of such large-scale streaming motions has important
implications for determining the Sun's motion about the Galactic Centre.
Using Red Clump stars from GALAH and APOGEE, we map the line-of-sight
velocities around the Sun (d $\lt$ 5 kpc), and |z| $\lt$1.25 kpc from the
mid-plane. By subtracting a smooth axisymmetric model for the velocity
field, we study the residual fluctuations and compare our findings with
mock survey generated by GALAXIA. We find negligible large-scale
fluctuations away from the plane. In the mid-plane, we reproduce the
earlier APOGEE power spectrum but with 20 per cent smaller amplitude
(9.3 km s$^{-1}$) after taking into account a few systematics
(e.g. volume completeness). Using a flexible axisymmetric model the
power amplitude is further reduced to 6.3 km s$^{-1}$.
Additionally, our simulations show that, in the plane, distances are
underestimated for high-mass Red Clump stars which can lead to spurious
power amplitude of about 5.2 km s$^{-1}$. Taking this into
account, we estimate the amplitude of real fluctuations to be $\lt$4.6 km
s$^{-1}$, about a factor of three less than the APOGEE result.

essential to find and describe planets in the early stages of their
evolution. This work seeks to identify nearby young stars showing a
lithium 6708 {\AA} absorption line in the GALAH survey. A robust,
data-driven approach is used to search for corresponding templates in
the pool of 434 215 measured dwarf spectra in the survey. It enables a
model-free search for best-matching spectral templates for all stars,
including M dwarfs with strong molecular absorption bands. 3147 stars
have been found to have measurable lithium: 1408 G and 892 K0-K5 dwarfs
(EW(Li) $\gt$ 0.1 {\AA}), 335 K5-K9 ($\gt$0.07 {\AA}) and 512 M0-M4
dwarfs ($\gt$0.05 {\AA}). Stars with such lithium features are used to
investigate the possibility of searching for young stars above the main
sequence based merely on their parallaxes and broad-band photometry. The
selection of young stars above the main sequence is highly effective for
M dwarfs, moderately effective for K dwarfs and ineffective for G
dwarfs. Using a combination of the lithium information and the complete
6D kinematics from Gaia and GALAH, 305 new candidate moving group
members have been found, 123 of which belong to the Scorpius-Centaurus

astrometric survey and the high-resolution Galactic Archaeology with
HERMES (GALAH) spectroscopic survey to analyse the structure of our
Galaxy's disc components. With GALAH, we separate the {$\alpha$}-rich and
{$\alpha$}-poor discs (with respect to Fe), which are superposed in both
position and velocity space, and examine their distributions in action
space. We study the distribution of stars in the zV$_{ z}$ phase
plane, for both V$_{varphi}$ and V$_{R}$, and recover the
remarkable `phase spiral' discovered by Gaia. We identify the
anticipated quadrupole signature in zV$_{ z}$ of a tilted velocity
ellipsoid for stars above and below the Galactic plane. By connecting
our work with earlier studies, we show that the phase spiral is likely
to extend well beyond the narrow solar neighbourhood cylinder in which
it was found. The phase spiral is a signature of corrugated waves that
propagate through the disc, and the associated non-equilibrium phase
mixing. The radially asymmetric distribution of stars involved in the
phase spiral reveals that the corrugation, which is mostly confined to
the {$\alpha$}-poor disc, grows in z-amplitude with increasing radius. We
present new simulations of tidal disturbance of the Galactic disc by the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf. The effect on the zV$_{ z}$ phase plane
lasts $\{${\gsim} $\}$ 2 Gyr, but a subsequent disc crossing wipes out the
coherent structure. We find that the phase spiral was excited $\{${\lsim} $\}$

	Abstract = {{Using effective temperature and metallicity derived from SDSS spectra
for \~{}60,000 F- and G-type main-sequence stars (0.2 $\lt$ g - r $\lt$ 0.6),
we develop polynomial models for estimating these parameters from the
SDSS u - g and g - r colors. These photometric estimates have similar
error properties as those determined from SDSS spectra. We apply this
method to SDSS photometric data for over 2 million F/G stars and measure
the unbiased metallicity distribution for a complete volume-limited
sample of stars at distances between 500 pc and 8 kpc. The metallicity
distribution can be exquisitely modeled using two components with a
spatially varying number ratio, which correspond to disk and halo. The
two components also possess the kinematics expected for disk and halo
stars. The metallicity of the halo component is spatially invariant,
while the median disk metallicity smoothly decreases with distance from
the Galactic plane from -0.6 at 500 pc to -0.8 beyond several
kiloparsecs. The absence of a correlation between metallicity and
kinematics for disk stars is in a conflict with the traditional
decomposition in terms of thin and thick disks. We detect coherent
substructures in the kinematics-metallicity space, such as the Monoceros
stream, which rotates faster than the LSR, and has a median metallicity
of [Fe/H] = -0.95, with an rms scatter of only \~{}0.15 dex. We extrapolate
our results to the performance expected from the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (LSST) and estimate that LSST will obtain metallicity
measurements accurate to 0.2 dex or better, with proper-motion
measurements accurate to \~{}0.5 mas yr$^{-1}$, for about 200 million
F/G dwarf stars within a distance limit of \~{}100 kpc (g $\lt$ 23.5).

	Abstract = {{The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) presents the first
spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS). This ninth data release (DR9) of the SDSS project includes
535,995 new galaxy spectra (median z \~{} 0.52), 102,100 new quasar spectra
(median z \~{} 2.32), and 90,897 new stellar spectra, along with the data
presented in previous data releases. These spectra were obtained with
the new BOSS spectrograph and were taken between 2009 December and 2011
July. In addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, which determines
radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, and
metallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements
in temperature estimates for stars with T $_{eff}$ $\lt$ 5000 K and
in metallicity estimates for stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.5. DR9 includes
new stellar parameters for all stars presented in DR8, including stars
from SDSS-I and II, as well as those observed as part of the SEGUE-2.
The astrometry error introduced in the DR8 imaging catalogs has been
corrected in the DR9 data products. The next data release for SDSS-III
will be in Summer 2013, which will present the first data from the
APOGEE along with another year of data from BOSS, followed by the final
SDSS-III data release in 2014 December.

	Abstract = {{Omega Centauri is the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way,
and possesses many peculiar properties. In particular, the cluster
contains distinct multiple stellar populations, with a large spread in
metallicity and different kinematics as a function of light elements
abundance, implying that it formed over an extended period of time. This
has lead to the suggestion that $\omega$ Cen is the remnant core of an
accreted dwarf galaxy. If this scenario is correct, $\omega$ Cen should
be tidally limited, and one should expect to find tidal debris spread
along its orbit. Here we use N-body simulations to show that the
recently-discovered `Fimbulthul' structure, identified in the second
data release (DR2) of the Gaia mission, is the long sought-for tidal
stream of $\omega$ Cen, extending up to $28\deg$ from the cluster.
Follow-up high-resolution spectroscopy of 5 stars in the stream show
that they are closely-grouped in velocity, and have metallicities
consistent with having originated in that cluster. Guided by our N-body
simulations, we devise a selection filter that we apply to Gaia data to
also uncover the portion of the stream in the highly-contaminated and
crowded field within $10\deg$ of $\omega$ Cen. Further modelling of the
stream may help to constrain the dynamical history of the dwarf galaxy
progenitor of this disrupting system and guide future searches for its
remnant stars in the Milky Way.

ecliptic, providing data suitable for large-scale asteroseismic analyses
to inform galactic archaeology studies. Its first campaign covered a
field near the north Galactic cap, a region never covered before by
large asteroseismic-ensemble investigations, and was therefore of
particular interest for exploring this part of our Galaxy. Here we
report the asteroseismic analysis of all stars selected by the K2
Galactic Archaeology Program during the mission's {\ldquo}north Galactic
cap{\rdquo} campaign 1. Our consolidated analysis uses six independent
methods to measure the global seismic properties, in particular the
large frequency separation and the frequency of maximum power. From the
full target sample of 8630 stars we find about 1200 oscillating red
giants, a number comparable with estimates from galactic synthesis
modeling. Thus, as a valuable by-product we find roughly 7500 stars to
be dwarfs, which provide a sample well suited for galactic exoplanet
occurrence studies because they originate from our simple and easily
reproducible selection function. In addition, to facilitate the full
potential of the data set for galactic archaeology, we assess the
detection completeness of our sample of oscillating red giants. We find
that the sample is at least nearly complete for stars with 40 {\lsim}

affecting the number of measurements of $\{$$\{${$\Delta$} $\}$$\}${$\nu$}  and possibly
also $\{${$\nu$} $\}$$_{\max }$. Although we can detect oscillations down
to $\{$$\backslash$text$\{$Kp$\}$$\}$ = 15, our campaign 1 sample lacks enough faint giants to

	Abstract = {{Photographic photometry has been obtained for 1200 stars in the
magnitude range of V = 13.5 to 17.5 in the field of the Galactic
globular cluster 47 Tucanae and used to form both a color-magnitude
diagram and a luminosity function. No gap at the base of the giant
branch of size similar to those recently reported in other clusters was
detected, but a prominent peak is present in the luminosity function at
a level approximately 0.5 mag below the horizontal branch. This peak is
identified with that which results from the passage of the
hydrogen-burning shell through the composition discontinuity left by the
deepest penetration of the convective envelope of the star. However, the
observed peak is nearly 1 mag fainter than the prediction of standard
stellar evolution theory for the age and composition of this cluster.
The most plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that it results
from overshoot at the base of the convective envelope of the stars. An
overshoot of approximately one local pressure scale height is sufficient
to produce agreement with the observations.

	Abstract = {{Towards the end of their lives, stars like the Sun greatly expand to
become red giant stars. Such evolved stars could provide stringent tests
of stellar theory, as many uncertainties of the internal stellar
structure accumulate with age. Important examples are convective
overshooting and rotational mixing during the central hydrogen-burning
phase, which determine the mass of the helium core, but which are not
well understood. In principle, analysis of radial and non-radial stellar
oscillations can be used to constrain the mass of the helium core.
Although all giants are expected to oscillate, it has hitherto been
unclear whether non-radial modes are observable at all in red giants, or
whether the oscillation modes have a short or a long mode lifetime,
which determines the observational precision of the frequencies. Here we
report the presence of radial and non-radial oscillations in more than
300 giant stars. For at least some of the giants, the mode lifetimes are
of the order of a month. We observe giant stars with equally spaced
frequency peaks in the Fourier spectrum of the time series, as well as
giants for which the spectrum seems to be more complex. No satisfactory
theoretical explanation currently exists for our observations.

	Abstract = {{We have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-series
photometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the Kepler
Mission. The light curves, obtained with 30 minute sampling, reveal
clear oscillations in a large sample of G and K giants, extending in
luminosity from the red clump down to the bottom of the giant branch. We
confirm a strong correlation between the large separation of the
oscillations ({$\Delta$}{$\nu$}) and the frequency of maximum power
({$\nu$}$_{max}$). We focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars
({$\nu$}$_{max}$ $\gt$ 100 {$\mu$}Hz, L $\lt$\~{} 30 L $_{sun}$) having
high signal-to-noise ratios and showing the unambiguous signature of
solar-like oscillations. These are H-shell-burning stars, whose
oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellar evolution
and for constraining the star formation rate in the local disk. We use a
new technique to compare stars on a single {\'e}chelle diagram by
scaling their frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to
radial and non-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes
with angular degree l = 3. Measuring the small separation between l = 0
and l = 2 allows us to plot the so-called C-D diagram of
{$\delta$}{$\nu$}$_{02}$ versus {$\Delta$}{$\nu$}. The small separation
{$\delta$}{$\nu$}$_{01}$ of l = 1 from the midpoint of adjacent l = 0
modes is negative, contrary to the Sun and solar-type stars. The ridge
for l = 1 is notably broadened, which we attribute to mixed modes,
confirming theoretical predictions for low-luminosity giants. Overall,
the results demonstrate the tremendous potential of Kepler data for
asteroseismology of red giants.

@article{Hansen2012,
	Abstract = {{Context. The rapid neutron-capture process, which created about half of
the heaviest elements in the solar system, is believed to have been
unique. Many recent studies have shown that this uniqueness is not true
for the formation of lighter elements, in particular those in the atomic
number range 38 $\lt$ Z $\lt$ 48. Among these, palladium (Pd) and
especially silver (Ag) are expected to be key indicators of a possible
second r-process, but until recently they have been studied only in a
few stars. We therefore target Pd and Ag in a large sample of stars and
compare these abundances to those of Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, and Eu produced by
the slow (s-) and rapid (r-) neutron-capture processes. Hereby we
investigate the nature of the formation process of Ag and Pd. <BR />
Aims: We study the abundances of seven elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Pd, Ag, Ba,
and Eu) to gain insight into the formation process of the elements and
explore in depth the nature of the second r-process. <BR /> Methods: By
adopting a homogeneous one-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium
(1D LTE) analysis of 71 stars, we derive stellar abundances using the
spectral synthesis code MOOG, and the MARCS model atmospheres. We
calculate abundance ratio trends and compare the derived abundances to
site-dependent yield predictions (low-mass O-Ne-Mg core-collapse
supernovae and parametrised high-entropy winds), to extract
characteristics of the second r-process. <BR /> Results: The seven
elements are tracers of different (neutron-capture) processes, which in
turn allows us to constrain the formation process(es) of Pd and Ag. The
abundance ratios of the heavy elements are found to be correlated and
anti-correlated. These trends lead to clear indications that a
second/weak r-process, is responsible for the formation of Pd and Ag. On
the basis of the comparison to the model predictions, we find that the
conditions under which this process takes place differ from those for
the main r-process in needing lower neutron number densities, lower
neutron-to-seed ratios, and lower entropies, and/or higher electron
abundances. <BR /> Conclusions: Our analysis confirms that Pd and Ag
form via a rapid neutron-capture process that differs from the main
r-process, the main and weak s-processes, and charged particle
freeze-outs. We find that this process is efficiently working down to
the lowest metallicity sampled by our analysis ([Fe/H] = - 3.3). Our
results may indicate that a combination of these explosive sites is
needed to explain the variety in the observationally derived abundance
patterns.

Space Telescope to obtain new high-quality spectra covering the 1900
$\lt$={$\lambda$} $\lt$= 2360 {\AA} wavelength range for two metal-poor
stars, HD 108317 and HD 128279. We derive abundances of Cu II, Zn II, As
I, Se I, Mo II, and Cd II, which have not been detected previously in
either star. Abundances derived for Ge I, Te I, Os II, and Pt I confirm
those derived from lines at longer wavelengths. We also derive upper
limits from the non-detection of W II, Hg II, Pb II, and Bi I. The mean
[As/Fe] ratio derived from these two stars and five others in the
literature is unchanged over the metallicity range -2.8 $\lt$
[Fe/H] $\lt$-0.6, lang[As/Fe]rang = +0.28 {\plusmn} 0.14 ({$\sigma$} =
0.36 dex). The mean [Se/Fe] ratio derived from these two stars and six
others in the literature is also constant, lang[Se/Fe]rang = +0.16
{\plusmn} 0.09 ({$\sigma$} = 0.26 dex). The As and Se abundances are
enhanced relative to a simple extrapolation of the iron-peak abundances
to higher masses, suggesting that this mass region (75 $\lt$=A $\lt$= 82)
may be the point at which a different nucleosynthetic mechanism begins
to dominate the quasi-equilibrium {$\alpha$}-rich freezeout of the iron
peak. lang[Cu II/Cu I]rang = +0.56 {\plusmn} 0.23 in HD 108317 and HD
128279, and we infer that lines of Cu I may not be formed in local
thermodynamic equilibrium in these stars. The [Zn/Fe], [Mo/Fe], [Cd/Fe],
and [Os/Fe] ratios are also derived from neutral and ionized species,
and each ratio pair agrees within the mutual uncertainties, which range
from 0.15 to 0.52 dex.

	Abstract = {{The kinematics of the Milky Way disc as a function of age are well
measured at the solar radius, but have not been studied over a wider
range of Galactocentric radii. Here, we measure the kinematics of
mono-age, mono-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ populations in the low and high
$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ discs between $4 \lesssim R \lesssim 13$ kpc and
$|z| \lesssim 2$ kpc using 65,719 stars in common between APOGEE DR14
and $\it{Gaia}$ DR2 for which we estimate ages using a Bayesian neural
network model trained on asteroseismic ages. We determine the vertical
and radial velocity dispersions, finding that the low and high
$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ discs display markedly different
age--velocity-dispersion relations (AVRs) and shapes
$\sigma\_z/\sigma\_R$. The high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc has roughly
flat AVRs and constant $\sigma\_z/\sigma\_R = 0.64\pm 0.04$, whereas the
low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc has large variations in this ratio which
positively correlate with the mean orbital radius of the population at
fixed age. The high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc component's flat AVRs
and constant $\sigma\_z/\sigma\_R$ clearly indicates an entirely different
heating history. Outer disc populations also have flatter radial AVRs
than those in the inner disc, likely due to the waning effect of spiral
arms. Our detailed measurements of AVRs and $\sigma\_z/\sigma\_R$ across
the disc indicate that low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$, inner disc ($R
\lesssim 10\,\mathrm{kpc}$) stellar populations are likely dynamically
heated by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while the
observed trends for outer disc populations require a significant
contribution from another heating mechanism such as satellite
perturbations. We also find that outer disc populations have slightly
positive mean vertical and radial velocities, likely because they are
part of the warped disc.

in which stars fall into high-$\alpha$, and low-$\alpha$ sequences. The
high-$\alpha$ sequence comprises mostly old stars, and the low-$\alpha$
sequence comprises primarily young stars. The origin of this dichotomy
is uncertain. To better understand how the high- and low-$\alpha$ stars
are affiliated, we examine if the high- and low-$\alpha$ sequences have
distinct orbits at all ages, or if age sets the orbital properties of
stars irrespective of their $\alpha$-enhancement. Orbital actions $J\_R$,
$J\_z$, and $J\_\phi$ (or $L\_z$) are our labels of stellar dynamics. We
use ages for 58,278 LAMOST stars (measured to a precision of 40$\backslash$\%)
within $\leq$2kpc of the Sun and we calculate orbital actions from
proper motions and parallaxes given by Gaia's DR2. We find that $\backslash$emph$\{$at
all ages$\}$, the high- and low-$\alpha$ sequences are dynamically
distinct. This implies separate formation and evolutionary histories for
the two sequences; a star's membership in the high- or low-$\alpha$
sequence indicates its dynamical properties at a given time. We use
action space to make an efficient selection of halo stars and
subsequently report a group of old, low-$\alpha$ stars in the halo,
which may be a discrete population from an infall event.

	Abstract = {{The disc structure of the Milky Way is marked by a chemical dichotomy,
with high-{$\alpha$} and low-{$\alpha$} abundance sequences, traditionally
identified with the geometric thick and thin discs. This identification
is aided by the old ages of the high-{$\alpha$} stars, and lower average
ages of the low-{$\alpha$} ones. Recent large-scale surveys such as APOGEE
have provided a wealth of data on this chemical structure, including
showing that an identification of chemical and geometric thick discs is
not exact, but the origin of the chemical dichotomy has remained
unclear. Here we demonstrate that a dichotomy arises naturally if the
early gas-rich disc fragments, leading to some fraction of the star
formation occuring in clumps of the type observed in high-redshift
galaxies. These clumps have high star formation rate density. They
therefore enrich rapidly, moving from the low-{$\alpha$} to the
high-{$\alpha$} sequence, while more distributed star formation produces
the low-{$\alpha$} sequence. We demonstrate that this model produces a
chemically defined thick disc that has many of the properties of the
Milky Way's thick disc. Because clump formation is common in
high-redshift galaxies, we predict that chemical bimodalities are common
in massive galaxies.

	Abstract = {{The r-process, or the rapid neutron-capture process, of stellar
nucleosynthesis is called for to explain the production of the stable
(and some long-lived radioactive) neutron-rich nuclides heavier than
iron that are observed in stars of various metallicities, as well as in
the solar system. A very large amount of nuclear information is
necessary in order to model the r-process. This concerns the static
characteristics of a large variety of light to heavy nuclei between the
valley of stability and the vicinity of the neutron-drip line, as well
as their beta-decay branches or their reactivity. Fission probabilities
of very neutron-rich actinides have also to be known in order to
determine the most massive nuclei that have a chance to be involved in
the r-process. Even the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter may
enter the problem. The enormously challenging experimental and
theoretical task imposed by all these requirements is reviewed, and the
state-of-the-art development in the field is presented.
Nuclear-physics-based and astrophysics-free r-process models of
different levels of sophistication have been constructed over the years.
We review their merits and their shortcomings. The ultimate goal of
r-process studies is clearly to identify realistic sites for the
development of the r-process. Here too, the challenge is enormous, and
the solution still eludes us. For long, the core collapse supernova of
massive stars has been envisioned as the privileged r-process location.
We present a brief summary of the one- or multidimensional spherical or
non-spherical explosion simulations available to-date. Their predictions
are confronted with the requirements imposed to obtain an r-process. The
possibility of r-nuclide synthesis during the decompression of the
matter of neutron stars following their merging is also discussed. Given
the uncertainties remaining on the astrophysical r-process site and on
the involved nuclear physics, any confrontation between predicted
r-process yields and observed abundances is clearly risky. A comparison
dealing with observed r-nuclide abundances in very metal-poor stars and
in the solar system is attempted on grounds of r-process models based on
parametrised astrophysics conditions. The virtues of the r-process
product actinides for dating old stars or the solar system are also
critically reviewed.

	Abstract = {{We present the chemical analysis of 49 giant stars of the globular
cluster NGC 2419, using medium resolution spectra collected with the
multi-object spectrograph DEIMOS@Keck. Previous analysis of this cluster
revealed a large dispersion in the line strength of the infrared Ca II
triplet, suggesting an intrinsic star-to-star scatter in its Fe or Ca
content. From our analysis, we assess that all the investigated stars
share the same [Fe/H], [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] abundance ratios, while a
large spread in Mg and K abundances is detected. The distribution of
[Mg/Fe] is bimodal, with {\tilde}40 per cent of the observed targets
having subsolar [Mg/Fe], down to [Mg/Fe] {\tilde} -1 dex, a level of Mg
deficiency never observed before in globular clusters. It is found that
the large dispersion in Mg abundances is likely the main origin of the
observed dispersion of the Ca II triplet lines strengths (that can be
erroneously interpreted in terms of Fe or Ca abundance scatter) because
Mg plays a relevant role in the atmosphere of giant stars as an electron
donor. A strong depletion in the Mg abundance leads to an increase of
the line strength of the Ca II triplet, due to the variation in the
electronic pressure, at a constant Fe and Ca abundance. Finally, we
detect an anti-correlation between Mg and K abundances, not easily
explainable within the framework of the current nucleosynthesis models.

the calcium abundance derived from stellar spectra in various ways,
depending on the lines used and the stellar atmospheric parameters. The
collection of atomic data adopted in non-LTE (NLTE) calculations must be
sufficiently complete and accurate. <BR /> Aims: We derive NLTE
abundances from high-quality observations and reliable stellar
parameters using a model atom built afresh for this work, and check the
consistency of our results over a wide wavelength range with transitions
of atomic and singly ionised calcium. <BR /> Methods: We built and
tested Ca I and Ca II model atoms with state-of-the-art radiative and
collisional data, and tested their performance deriving the Ca abundance
in three benchmark stars: Procyon, the Sun, and Arcturus. We have
excellent-quality observations and accurate stellar parameters for these
stars. Two methods to derive the LTE/NLTE abundances were used and
compared. The LTE/NLTE centre-to-limb variation (CLV) of Ca lines in the
Sun was also investigated. <BR /> Results: The two methods used give
similar results in all three stars. Several discrepancies found in LTE
do not appear in our NLTE results; in particular the agreement between
abundances in the visual and infra-red (IR) and the Ca I and Ca II
ionisation balance is improved overall, although substantial
line-to-line scatter remains. The CLV of the calcium lines around 6165
{\AA} can be partially reproduced. We suspect differences between our
modelling and CLV results are due to inhomogeneities in the atmosphere
that require 3D modelling.

	Abstract = {{Carbon and oxygen are key tracers of the Galactic chemical evolution; in
particular, a reported upturn in [C/O] towards decreasing [O/H] in
metal-poor halo stars could be a signature of nucleosynthesis by massive
Population III stars. We reanalyse carbon, oxygen, and iron abundances
in 39 metal-poor turn-off stars. For the first time, we take into
account 3D hydrodynamic effects together with departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) when determining both the stellar
parameters and the elemental abundances, by deriving effective
temperatures from 3D non-LTE H{$\beta$} profiles, surface gravities from
Gaia parallaxes, iron abundances from 3D LTE Fe II equivalent widths,
and carbon and oxygen abundances from 3D non-LTE C I and O I equivalent
widths. We find that [C/Fe] stays flat with [Fe/H], whereas [O/Fe]
increases linearly up to 0.75 dex with decreasing [Fe/H] down to -3.0
dex. Therefore [C/O] monotonically decreases towards decreasing [C/H],
in contrast to previous findings, mainly because the non-LTE effects for
O I at low [Fe/H] are weaker with our improved calculations.

	Abstract = {{We explore the relationship between young, embedded binaries and their
parent cores, using observations within the Perseus Molecular Cloud. We
combine recently published Very Large Array observations of young stars
with core properties obtained from Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer
Array 2 observations at 850 {$\mu$}m. Most embedded binary systems are
found towards the centres of their parent cores, although several
systems have components closer to the core edge. Wide binaries, defined
as those systems with physical separations greater than 500 au, show a
tendency to be aligned with the long axes of their parent cores, whereas
tight binaries show no preferred orientation. We test a number of
simple, evolutionary models to account for the observed populations of
Class 0 and I sources, both single and binary. In the model that best
explains the observations, all stars form initially as wide binaries.
These binaries either break up into separate stars or else shrink into
tighter orbits. Under the assumption that both stars remain embedded
following binary break-up, we find a total star formation rate of 168
Myr$^{-1}$. Alternatively, one star may be ejected from the dense
core due to binary break-up. This latter assumption results in a star
formation rate of 247 Myr$^{-1}$. Both production rates are in
satisfactory agreement with current estimates from other studies of
Perseus. Future observations should be able to distinguish between these
two possibilities. If our model continues to provide a good fit to other
star-forming regions, then the mass fraction of dense cores that becomes
stars is double what is currently believed.

	Abstract = {{Probing the origin of r-process elements in the universe represents a
multi-disciplinary challenge. We review the observational evidence that
probe the properties of r-process sites, and address them using galactic
chemical evolution simulations, binary population synthesis models, and
nucleosynthesis calculations. Our motivation is to define which
astrophysical sites have significantly contributed to the total mass of
r-process elements present in our Galaxy. We found discrepancies with
the neutron star (NS-NS) merger scenario. Assuming they are the only
site, the decreasing trend of [Eu/Fe] at [Fe/H]$\backslash$,$\gt-1$ in the disk of
the Milky Way cannot be reproduced while accounting for the delay-time
distribution (DTD) of coalescence times ($\propto~t^{-1}$) derived from
short gamma-ray bursts and population synthesis models. Steeper DTD
functions ($\propto~t^{-1.5}$) or power laws combined with a strong
burst of mergers before the onset of Type\~{}Ia supernovae can reproduce
the [Eu/Fe] trend, but this scenario is inconsistent with the similar
fraction of short gamma-ray bursts and Type\~{}Ia supernovae occurring in
early-type galaxies, and reduces the probability of detecting GW170817
in an early-type galaxy. One solution is to assume an extra production
site of Eu that would be active in the early universe, but would fade
away with increasing metallicity. If this is correct, this extra site
could be responsible for roughly 50\% of the Eu production in the early
universe, before the onset of Type\~{}Ia supernovae. Rare classes of
supernovae could be this additional r-process source, but hydrodynamic
simulations still need to ensure the conditions for a robust r-process
pattern.

	Abstract = {{In this Letter, we report on a low-resolution spectroscopic survey for
Li-rich K giants among 2000 low-mass (M $\lt$= 3 M $_{sun}$) giants
spanning the luminosity range from below to above the luminosity of the
clump. Fifteen new Li-rich giants including four super Li-rich K giants
(log epsilon(Li) $\gt$=3.2) were discovered. A significant finding is
that there is a concentration of Li-rich K giants at the luminosity of
the clump or red horizontal branch. This new finding is partly a
consequence of the fact that our low-resolution survey is the first
large survey to include giants well below and above the red giant branch
(RGB) bump and clump locations in the H-R diagram. Origin of the lithium
enrichment may be plausibly attributed to the conversion of
$^{3}$He via $^{7}$Be to $^{7}$Li by the
Cameron-Fowler mechanism but the location for the onset of the
conversion is uncertain. Two possible opportunities to effect this
conversion are discussed: the bump in the first ascent of the RGB and
the He-core flash at the tip of the RGB. The finite luminosity spread of
the Li-rich giants serves to reject the idea that Li enhancement is, in
general, a consequence of a giant swallowing a large planet.

	Abstract = {{The chemical evolution of the Universe is governed by the chemical
yields from stars, which in turn are determined primarily by the initial
stellar mass. Even stars as low as 0.9 M$_{&sun;}$ can, at low
metallicity, contribute to the chemical evolution of elements. Stars
less massive than about 10 M$_{&sun;}$ experience recurrent mixing
events that can significantly change the surface composition of the
envelope, with observed enrichments in carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, and
heavy elements synthesized by the slow neutron capture process (the
s-process). Low- and intermediate-mass stars release their
nucleosynthesis products through stellar outflows or winds, in contrast
to massive stars that explode as core-collapse supernovae. Here we
review the stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis for single stars up to
\~{} 10 M$_{&sun;}$ from the main sequence through to the tip of the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We include a discussion of the main
uncertainties that affect theoretical calculations and review the latest
observational data, which are used to constrain uncertain details of the
stellar models. We finish with a review of the stellar yields available
for stars less massive than about 10 M$_{&sun;}$ and discuss
efforts by various groups to address these issues and provide
homogeneous yields for low- and intermediate-mass stars covering a broad
range of metallicities.

thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is presented. The
models cover a range in metallicity Z = 0.02, 0.008, 0.004 and 0.0001,
and masses between 1 and 6M$_{solar}$. New intermediate-mass (M
$\gt$= 3M$_{solar}$) Z = 0.0001 AGB models are also presented,
along with a finer mass grid than used in previous studies. The yields
are computed using an updated reaction rate network that includes the
latest NeNa and MgAl proton capture rates, with the main result that
between \~{}6 and 30 times less Na is produced by intermediate-mass models
with hot bottom burning. In low-mass AGB models, we investigate the
effect, on the production of light elements, of including some partial
mixing of protons into the intershell region during the deepest extent
of each third dredge-up episode. The protons are captured by the
abundant $^{12}$C to form a $^{13}$C pocket. The
$^{13}$C pocket increases the yields of $^{19}$F,
$^{23}$Na, the neutron-rich Mg and Si isotopes, $^{60}$Fe
and $^{31}$P. The increase in $^{31}$P is by factors of \~{}4
to 20, depending on the metallicity. Any structural changes caused by
the addition of the $^{13}$C pocket into the He intershell are
ignored. However, the models considered are of low mass and any such
feedback is likely to be small. Further study is required to test the
accuracy of the yields from the partial-mixing models. For each mass and
metallicity, the yields are presented in a tabular form suitable for use
in galactic chemical evolution studies or for comparison to the
composition of planetary nebulae.

	Abstract = {{We present updated calculations of stellar evolutionary sequences and
detailed nucleosynthesis predictions for the brightest asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars in the Galaxy with masses between 5 M
$_{&sun;}$ and 9 M $_{&sun;}$, with an initial metallicity
of Z = 0.02 ([Fe/H] = 0.14). In our previous studies we used the
Vassiliadis {\amp} Wood mass-loss rate, which stays low until the
pulsation period reaches 500 days after which point a superwind begins.
Vassiliadis {\amp} Wood noted that for stars over 2.5 M $_{&sun;}$
the superwind should be delayed until P {\ap} 750 days at 5 M
$_{&sun;}$. We calculate evolutionary sequences where we delay the
onset of the superwind to pulsation periods of P {\ap} 700-800 days in
models of M = 5, 6, and 7 M $_{&sun;}$. Post-processing
nucleosynthesis calculations show that the 6 and 7 M $_{&sun;}$
models produce the most Rb, with [Rb/Fe] {\ap}1 dex, close to the average
of most of the Galactic Rb-rich stars ([Rb/Fe] {\ap}1.4 {\plusmn} 0.8
dex). Changing the rate of the $^{22}$Ne +{$\alpha$} reactions
results in variations of [Rb/Fe] as large as 0.5 dex in models with a
delayed superwind. The largest enrichment in heavy elements is found for
models that adopt the NACRE rate of the $^{22}$Ne({$\alpha$},
n)$^{25}$Mg reaction. Using this rate allows us to best match the
composition of most of the Rb-rich stars. A synthetic evolution
algorithm is then used to remove the remaining envelope resulting in
final [Rb/Fe] of {\ap}1.4 dex although with C/O ratios $\gt$1. We conclude
that delaying the superwind may account for the large Rb overabundances
observed in the brightest metal-rich AGB stars.

	Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive study of the abundance evolution of the
elements from H to U in the Milky Way halo and local disc. We use a
consistent chemical evolution model, metallicity-dependent isotopic
yields from low and intermediate mass stars and yields from massive
stars which include, for the first time, the combined effect of
metallicity, mass loss, and rotation for a large grid of stellar masses
and for all stages of stellar evolution. The yields of massive stars are
weighted by a metallicity-dependent function of the rotational
velocities, constrained by observations as to obtain a primary-like
$^{14}$N behaviour at low metallicity and to avoid overproduction
of s-elements at intermediate metallicities. We show that the Solar
system isotopic composition can be reproduced to better than a factor of
2 for isotopes up to the Fe-peak, and at the 10 per cent level for most
pure s-isotopes, both light ones (resulting from the weak s-process in
rotating massive stars) and the heavy ones (resulting from the main
s-process in low and intermediate mass stars). We conclude that the
light element primary process (LEPP), invoked to explain the apparent
abundance deficiency of the s-elements with A $\lt$ 100, is not
necessary. We also reproduce the evolution of the heavy to light
s-elements abundance ratio ([hs/ls]) - recently observed in unevolved
thin disc stars - as a result of the contribution of rotating massive
stars at sub-solar metallicities. We find that those stars produce
primary F and dominate its solar abundance and we confirm their role in
the observed primary behaviour of N. In contrast, we show that their
action is insufficient to explain the small observed values of
\^{}$\{$12$\}$C/\^{}$\{$13$\}$C in halo red giants, which is rather due to internal
processes in those stars.

	Abstract = {{Context. We reassess the problem of the production and evolution of the
light elements Li, Be and B and of their isotopes in the Milky Way in
the light of new observational and theoretical developments. <BR />
Aims: The main novelty is the introduction of a new scheme for the
origin of Galactic cosmic rays (GCR), which for the first time enables a
self-consistent calculation of their composition during galactic
evolution. <BR /> Methods: The scheme accounts for key features of the
present-day GCR source composition, it is based on the wind yields of
the Geneva models of rotating, mass-losing stars and it is fully coupled
to a detailed galactic chemical evolution code. <BR /> Results: We find
that the adopted GCR source composition accounts naturally for the
observations of primary Be and helps understanding why Be follows Fe
more closely than O. We find that GCR produce \~{}70\% of the solar
$^{11}$B/$^{10}$B isotopic ratio; the remaining 30\% of
$^{11}$B presumably result from {$\nu$}-nucleosynthesis in massive
star explosions. We find that GCR and primordial nucleosynthesis can
produce at most \~{}30\% of solar Li. At least half of the solar Li has to
originate in low-mass stellar sources (red giants, asymptotic giant
branch stars, or novae), but the required average yields of those
sources are found to be much higher than obtained in current models of
stellar nucleosynthesis. We also present radial profiles of LiBeB
elemental and isotopic abundances in the Milky Way disc. We argue that
the shape of those profiles - and the late evolution of LiBeB in general
- reveals important features of the production of those light elements
through primary and secondary processes.

	Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that $^{7}$Li can be created in low-mass
red giant stars via the Cameron-Fowler mechanism, due to extra deep
mixing and the associated ``cool bottom processing.'' Under certain
conditions, this $^{7}$Li creation can take the place of the
$^{7}$Li destruction normally expected. Note that such extra
mixing on the red giant branch (RGB) has previously been invoked to
explain the observed $^{13}$C enhancement. This new $^{7}$Li
production can account for the recent discovery of surprisingly high
lithium abundances in some low-mass red giants (a few of which are
superrich lithium stars, with abundances higher than that in the
interstellar medium). The amount of $^{7}$Li produced can exceed
log{\epsi}($^{7}$Li)\~{}4, but depends critically on the details of
the extra mixing mechanism (mixing speeds, geometry, episodicity). If
the deep circulation is a relatively long-lived, continuous process,
lithium-rich RGB stars should be completely devoid of beryllium and
boron. Cool bottom processing leads to $^{3}$He destruction in
low-mass stars; in contrast to the $^{7}$Li creation, the extent
of $^{3}$He depletion is largely independent of the details of the
extra mixing mechanism. The overall contribution from solar-metallicity
stars (from 1 to 40 M$_{solar}$) is expected to be a net
destruction of $^{3}$He, with an overall $^{3}$He survival
fraction g$_{3}$\~{}0.9+/-0.2 (weighted average over all stellar
masses); this is in contrast to the conclusion from standard dredge-up
theory, which would predict that stars are net producers of
$^{3}$He (with g$^{dr}$$_{3}$\~{}2.4+/-0.5). Population
II stars experience even more severe $^{3}$He depletion, with
0.3$\lt$\~{}g$_{3}$$\lt$\~{}0.7. Destruction of $^{3}$He in low-mass
stars is consistent with the requirements of Galactic chemical evolution
models; it would also result in some relaxation of the upper bound on
the primordial (D+$^{3}$He)/H abundance, thus relaxing the lower
bound on the cosmic baryon density {$\Omega$}$_{b}$ from big bang
nucleosynthesis calculations. For reference, we also present the effects
of standard first and second dredge-up on the helium, lithium,
beryllium, and boron isotopes.

	Abstract = {{Summary. In the framework of Arnett's (1969) model, the post-shock
explosive nucleosynthesis of hydrogen- rich layers is investigated with
particular emphasis on the thermonuclear production of 7Li and 11B.
Rather large ranges of peak temperatures and densities are shown to be
consistent with the production of 7Li or 11B by this mechanism.
Particularly in the 7Li case, the overproduction with respect to the
solar composition is often appreciable. As far as 11B is concerned, the
results depend rather sensitively on the choice of the explosive
expansion time scale parameters and on the uncertainties in the 11C(p,
y)12N rate. In fact, our study shows that the probability of a
substantial 11B production increases with decreasing explosion time
scale (for a given peak density) and decreasing rate of the proton
capture by 11C. It is also demonstrated that there exists a range of
temperature-density conditions (T0 4-6 x 108 0K; 1- t03g cm 3) for which
the enhanced production of both 7Li and 11B - sometimes together with
13C, 15N and 170 - occurs in relative concentrations consistent with
solar system abundances (Cameron, 1968, 1973). Key words: explosive

	Abstract = {{Primordial nucleosynthesis is one of the three historical evidences for
the big bang model, together with the expansion of the universe and the
cosmic microwave background. There is a good global agreement between
the computed primordial abundances of helium-4, deuterium, helium-3 and
their values deduced from observations. Now that the number of neutrino
families and the baryonic densities have been fixed by laboratory
measurements or CMB observations, the model has no free parameter and
its predictions are rigid. Since this is the earliest cosmic process for
which we a priori know all the physics involved, departure from its
predictions could provide hints or constraints on new physics or
astrophysics in the early universe. Precision on primordial abundances
deduced from observations has recently been drastically improved and
reach the percent level for both deuterium and helium-4. Accordingly,
the BBN predictions should reach the same level of precision. For most
isotopes, the dominant sources of uncertainty come from those on the
laboratory thermonuclear reactions. This article focuses on helium-4
whose predicted primordial abundance depends essentially on weak
interactions which control the neutron-proton ratio. The rates of the
various weak interaction processes depend on the experimentally measured
neutron lifetime, but also includes numerous corrections that we
thoroughly investigate here. They are the radiative, zero-temperature,
corrections, finite nucleon mass corrections, finite temperature
radiative corrections, weak-magnetism, and QED plasma effects, which are
for the first time all included and calculated in a self consistent way,
allowing to take into account the correlations between them, and
verifying that all satisfy detailed balance. Finally, we include the
incomplete neutrino decoupling and claim to reach a 10$^{-4}$
accuracy on the helium-4 predicted mass fraction of 0 . 24709 {\plusmn} 0
. 00017 (when including the uncertainty on the neutron lifetime). In
addition, we provide a Mathematica primordial nucleosynthesis code that
incorporates, not only these corrections but also a full network of
reactions, using the best available thermonuclear reaction rates,
allowing the predictions of primordial abundances of helium-4,
deuterium, helium-3 and lithium-7 but also of heavier isotopes up to the
CNO region.

main-squence fitting to 10 selected clusters, in order to obtain their

ensure consistency in the whole procedure. The resulting Open Cluster
ages connect well to our previous Globular Cluster results. From the
Open Cluster sample, as well as from the combined sample, questions

The age of the oldest open clusters (NGC 6791 and Be 17) is of the order
of 10 Gyr. We determine a delay by 2.0{\plusmn}1.5 Gyr between the start
of the halo and thin disk formation, whereas thin and thick disk started
to form approximately at the same time. We do not find any significant
age-metallicity relationship for the open cluster sample. The cumulative
age distribution of the whole open cluster sample shows a moderately
significant ({\tilde} 2{$\sigma$} level) departure from the predictions for
an exponentially declining dissolution rate with timescale of 2.5 Gyr.
The cumulative age distribution does not show any trend with
galactocentric distance, but the clusters with larger height to the
Galactic plane have an excess of objects between 2-4 and 6 Gyr with
respect to their counterpart closer to the plane of the Galaxy.

best-fit models, we create simulated stellar catalogues covering the
whole DES footprint down to $g = 24$ magnitude. Comparisons of data and
simulations provide evidence for a break in the power law index
describing the stellar density of the Milky Way (MW) halo. Several
previously discovered stellar over-densities are recovered in the
residual stellar density map, showing the reliability of MWFitting in
determining the Galactic components. Simulations made with the
best-fitting parameters are a promising way to predict MW star counts
for surveys such as LSST and Euclid.

that are more luminous than would be expected on the basis of their
spectral type and distance. During an investigation of the 329 best
Solar twin candidates uncovered among the spectra acquired by the GALAH
survey, we identified 64 such over-luminous stars. In order to
investigate their exact composition, we developed a data-driven
methodology that can generate a synthetic photometric signature and
spectrum of a single star. By combining multiple such synthetic stars
into an unresolved binary or triple system and comparing the results to
the actual photometric and spectroscopic observations, we uncovered 6
definitive triple stellar system candidates and an additional 14
potential candidates whose combined spectrum mimics the Solar spectrum.
Considering the volume correction factor for a magnitude limited survey,
the fraction of probable unresolved triple stars with long orbital
periods is \~{}2 \%. Possible orbital configurations of the candidates were
investigated using the selection and observational limits. To validate
the discovered multiplicity fraction, the same procedure was used to
evaluate the multiplicity fraction of other stellar types.

	Abstract = {{The overlap between the spectroscopic Galactic Archaeology with HERMES
(GALAH) survey and Gaia provides a high-dimensional chemodynamical space
of unprecedented size. We present a first analysis of a subset of this
overlap, of 7066 dwarf, turn-off, and sub-giant stars. These stars have
spectra from the GALAH survey and high parallax precision from the Gaia
DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution. We investigate correlations between
chemical compositions, ages, and kinematics for this sample. Stellar
parameters and elemental abundances are derived from the GALAH spectra
with the spectral synthesis code SPECTROSCOPY MADE EASY. We determine
kinematics and dynamics, including action angles, from the Gaia
astrometry and GALAH radial velocities. Stellar masses and ages are
determined with Bayesian isochrone matching, using our derived stellar
parameters and absolute magnitudes. We report measurements of Li, C, O,
Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, as well as
Ba and we note that we have employed non-LTE calculations for Li, O, Al,
and Fe. We show that the use of astrometric and photometric data
improves the accuracy of the derived spectroscopic parameters,
especially log g. Focusing our investigation on the correlations between
stellar age, iron abundance [Fe/H], and mean alpha-enhancement
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] of the magnitude-selected sample, we recover the result
that stars of the high-{$\alpha$} sequence are typically older than stars
in the low-{$\alpha$} sequence, the latter spanning iron abundances of -0.7
$\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ +0.5. While these two sequences become
indistinguishable in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] at the metal-rich regime,
we find that age can be used to separate stars from the extended
high-{$\alpha$} and the low-{$\alpha$} sequence even in this regime. When
dissecting the sample by stellar age, we find that the old stars ($\gt$8
Gyr) have lower angular momenta L$_{z}$ than the Sun, which
implies that they are on eccentric orbits and originate from the inner
disc. Contrary to some previous smaller scale studies we find a
continuous evolution in the high-{$\alpha$}-sequence up to super-solar
[Fe/H] rather than a gap, which has been interpreted as a separate
``high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich'' population. Stars in our sample that are
younger than 10 Gyr, are mainly found on the low {$\alpha$}-sequence and
show a gradient in L$_{z}$ from low [Fe/H] (L$_{z}$ $\gt$
L$_{z, &sun;}$) towards higher [Fe/H] (L$_{z}$ $\lt$ L$_{z,
&sun;}$), which implies that the stars at the ends of this sequence
are likely not originating from the close solar vicinity.

	Abstract = {{We present the kinematic results from our ARGOS spectroscopic survey of
the Galactic bulge of the Milky Way. Our aim is to understand the
formation of the Galactic bulge. We examine the kinematics of about 17
400 stars in the bulge located within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic Centre,
identified from the 28 000 star ARGOS survey. We aim to determine if the
formation of the bulge has been internally driven from disc
instabilities as suggested by its boxy shape, or if mergers have played
a significant role as expected from lambda cold dark matter simulations.
From our velocity measurements across latitudes b = -5{\deg}, - 7.5{\deg}
and -10{\deg} we find the bulge to be a cylindrically rotating system
that transitions smoothly out into the disc. From observations of 3
fields at b = +10, the kinematics of the bulge show North-South symmetry
about the major axis. Within the bulge, we find a kinematically distinct
metal-poor population ([Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.0) that is not rotating
cylindrically. The 5 per cent of our stars with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.0 are a
slowly rotating spheroidal population, which we believe are stars of the
metal-weak thick disc and halo which presently lie in the inner Galaxy.
The kinematics of the two bulge components that we identified in ARGOS
Paper III (mean [Fe/H] {\ap} -0.25 and [Fe/H] {\ap} +0.15, respectively)
demonstrate that they are likely to share a common formation origin and
are distinct from the more metal-poor populations of the thick disc and
halo which are co-located inside the bulge. We do not exclude an
underlying merger generated bulge component but our results favour bulge
formation from instabilities in the early thin disc.

	Abstract = {{The Milky Way bulge offers a unique opportunity to investigate in detail
the role that different processes such as dynamical instabilities,
hierarchical merging, and dissipational collapse may have played in the
history of the Galaxy formation and evolution based on its resolved
stellar population properties. Large observation programs and surveys of
the bulge are providing for the first time a look into the global view
of the Milky Way bulge that can be compared with the bulges of other
galaxies, and be used as a template for detailed comparison with models.
The Milky Way has been shown to have a boxy/peanut (B/P) bulge and
recent evidence seems to suggest the presence of an additional
spheroidal component. In this review we summarize the global chemical
abundances, kinematics and structural properties that allow us to
disentangle these multiple components and provide constraints to
understand their origin. The investigation of both detailed and global
properties of the bulge now provide us with the opportunity to
characterize the bulge as observed in models, and to place the mixed
component bulge scenario in the general context of external galaxies.
When writing this review, we considered the perspectives of researchers
working with the Milky Way and researchers working with external
galaxies. It is an attempt to approach both communities for a fruitful
exchange of ideas.

	Abstract = {{There is ample evidence in the Milky Way for globular cluster (GC)
disruption. Hence one may expect that also part of the Galactic halo
field stars may once have formed in GCs. We quantify the fraction of
halo stars donated by GCs by searching for stars that bear the unique
chemical fingerprints typical for a subset of GC stars often dubbed
`second-generation stars'. These are stars showing light element
abundance anomalies such as a pronounced CN-band strength accompanied by
weak CH-bands. Based on this indicator, past studies have placed the
fraction of halo stars with a GC origin between a few to up to 50\%.
Using low-resolution spectra from the most recent data release of the
latest extension of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV), we were able
to identify 118 metal-poor ($-1.8\le$[Fe/H]$\le -1.3$) CN-strong stars
in a sample of 4470 halo giant stars out to 50 kpc. This results in an
observed fraction of these stars of 2.6$\pm$0.2\%. Using an updated
formalism to account for the fraction of stars lost early on in the GCs'
evolution we estimate the fraction of the halo that stems from disrupted
clusters to be 11$\pm$1\%. This number represents the case that stars
lost from GCs were entirely from the first generation and is thus merely
an upper limit. Our conclusions are sensitive to our assumptions of the
mass lost early on from the first generation formed in the GCs, the
ratio of first-to-second generation stars, and other GC parameters. We
carefully test the influence of varying these parameters on the final
result and find that, under realistic scenarios, the above fraction
depends on the main assumptions at less than 10\%. We further recover a
flat trend in this fraction with Galactocentric radius, with a marginal
indication of a rise beyond 30 kpc that could reflect the ex-situ origin
of the outer halo. (abridged)

evolved stars with Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment spectroscopic parameters and Kepler asteroseismic data
analyzed using five independent techniques. Our data include
evolutionary state, surface gravity, mean density, mass, radius, age,
and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive
them. We employ a new empirical approach for combining asteroseismic
measurements from different methods, calibrating the inferred stellar
parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With high statistical
significance, we find that asteroseismic parameters inferred from the
different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed by
accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include
theoretically motivated corrections to the large frequency spacing
({$\Delta$}{$\nu$}) scaling relation, and we calibrate the zero-point of the
frequency of the maximum power ({$\nu$} $_{max}$) relation to be
consistent with masses and radii for members of star clusters. For most
targets, the parameters returned by different pipelines are in much
better agreement than would be expected from the pipeline-predicted
random errors, but 22\% of them had at least one method not return a
result and a much larger measurement dispersion. This supports the usage
of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population
studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental
calibrators is consistent with our error model, which yields median
random and systematic mass uncertainties for RGB stars of order 4\%.
Median random and systematic mass uncertainties are at the 9\% and 8\%
level, respectively, for red clump stars.

	Abstract = {{The scaling relations that relate the average asteroseismic parameters
$\{$$\{${$\Delta$} $\}$$\}${$\nu$}  and $\{${$\nu$} $\}$$_{\max }$ to the global properties

While the $\{$$\{${$\Delta$} $\}$$\}${$\nu$}  scaling relation has been examined carefully
and the deviations from the relation have been well documented, the
$\{${$\nu$} $\}$$_{\max }$ scaling relation has not been examined as
extensively. In this paper, we examine the $\{${$\nu$} $\}$$_{\max }$
scaling relation using a set of stellar models constructed to have a
wide range of mass, metallicity, and age. We find that as with $\{$$\{${$\Delta$}
$\}$$\}${$\nu$} , $\{${$\nu$} $\}$$_{\max }$ does not follow the simple scaling
relation. The most visible deviation is because of a mean molecular
weight term and a $\{$$\{$$\{${$\Gamma$} $\}$$\}$$\}$$_{1}$ term that are commonly
ignored. The remaining deviation is more difficult to address. We find
that the influence of the scaling relation errors on asteroseismically
derived values of $\{$log$\}$g are well within uncertainties. The influence of
the errors on mass and radius estimates is small for main sequence and
subgiants, but can be quite large for red giants.

and Gaia DR1 (TGAS) for 2200 Kepler stars spanning from the main
sequence to the red-giant branch. We show that previously identified
offsets between TGAS parallaxes and distances derived from
asteroseismology and eclipsing binaries have likely been overestimated
for parallaxes {\lsim} 5$\{$--$\}$10 mas ({\ap}90\%-98\% of the TGAS
sample). The observed differences in our sample can furthermore be
partially compensated by adopting a hotter $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$ scale
(such as the infrared flux method) instead of spectroscopic temperatures
for dwarfs and subgiants. Residual systematic differences are at the
{\ap}2\% level in parallax across three orders of magnitude. We use TGAS
parallaxes to empirically demonstrate that asteroseismic radii are
accurate to {\ap}5\% or better for stars between {\ap} 0.8$\{$--$\}$8

({\lsim} 1.5 $\{$R$\}$$_{&sun; }$) and low-luminosity RGB stars
({\ap}3-8 $\{$R$\}$$_{&sun; }$), but seismic radii appear to be
systematically underestimated by {\ap}5\% for subgiants ({\ap}1.5-3

metallicity between [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$]{\ap} -0.8 to +0.4 dex, and show
tentative evidence that corrections to the scaling relation for the
large frequency separation ($\{$$\{${$\Delta$} $\}$$\}${$\nu$} ) improve the agreement
with TGAS for RGB stars. Finally, we demonstrate that beyond {\ap} 3
$\{$kpc$\}$ asteroseismology will provide more precise distances than
end-of-mission Gaia data, highlighting the synergy and complementary

	Abstract = {{Fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius, and age, can be
inferred using asteroseismology. Cool stars with convective envelopes
have turbulent motions that can stochastically drive and damp
pulsations. The properties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum
can be tied to mass and radius through solar-scaled asteroseismic
relations. Stellar properties derived using these scaling relations need
verification over a range of metallicities. Because the age and mass of
halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysical priors, they provide an
independent, empirical check on asteroseismic mass estimates in the
low-metallicity regime. We identify nine metal-poor red giants
(including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo)
from a sample observed by both the Kepler space telescope and the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey-III APOGEE spectroscopic survey. We compare masses
inferred using asteroseismology to those expected for halo and
thick-disk stars. Although our sample is small, standard scaling
relations, combined with asteroseismic parameters from the APOKASC
Catalog, produce masses that are systematically higher ($\lt${$\Delta$}M
$\gt$ =0.17 {\plusmn} 0.05 M $_{&sun;}$) than astrophysical
expectations. The magnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known
theoretical corrections to the measured large frequency separation
scaling relationship. Using alternative methods for measuring
asteroseismic parameters induces systematic shifts at the 0.04 M
$_{&sun;}$ level. We also compare published asteroseismic analyses
with scaling relationship masses to examine the impact of using the
frequency of maximum power as a constraint. Upcoming APOKASC
observations will provide a larger sample of \~{}100 metal-poor stars,
important for detailed asteroseismic characterization of Galactic
stellar populations.

	Abstract = {{Asteroseismology can provide joint constraints on masses and radii of
individual stars. While this approach has been extensively tested for
red giant branch (RGB) stars, it has been more difficult to test for
helium core-burning red-clump (RC) giants because of the lack of
fundamental calibrators. To provide independent mass estimates, we
utilize a number of widely used horizontal-branch (HB) models in the
literature, and derive photometric masses from a comparison with
$griBVI\_CJHK\_s$ photometry. Our selected models disagree with each other
on the predicted mass-luminosity-temperature relation. We adopt
first-order corrections on colors and magnitudes to minimize the
dispersion between different models by forcing models to match the
observed location in the solar-metallicity cluster M67. Even for these
calibrated models, however, the internal consistency between models
deteriorates at higher metallicities, and photometric mass estimates
generally become smaller than asteroseismic masses, as seen from
metal-rich field RC stars with Gaia trigonometric parallaxes. As a
concrete example, the average photometric mass for RC giants in the old,
metal-rich cluster, NGC 6791, ranges from $0.7\ M\_\odot$ to $1.1\
M\_\odot$, depending on the specific set of models employed. An ensemble
average of the photometric masses ($0.88\pm0.16\ M\_\odot$) in NGC 6791
is only marginally consistent with the asteroseismic mass ($1.16\pm0.04\
M\_\odot$). There is a clear tension between the masses that one would
predict from photometry for metal-rich field RC stars, asteroseismic
masses, and those that would be expected from the ages of stars in the
Galactic disk populations and canonical RGB mass loss. We conclude that
standard RC models need to be re-examined in light of these powerful new
data sets.

	Abstract = {{The advent of large-scale spectroscopic surveys underscores the need to
develop robust techniques for determining stellar properties (``labels'',
i.e., physical parameters and elemental abundances). However,
traditional spectroscopic methods that utilize stellar models struggle
to reproduce cool ($\lt$4700 K) stellar atmospheres due to an abundance
of unconstrained molecular transitions, making modeling via synthetic
spectral libraries difficult. Because small, cool stars such as K and M
dwarfs are both common and good targets for finding small, cool planets,
establishing precise spectral modeling techniques for these stars is of
high priority. To address this, we apply The Cannon, a data-driven
method of determining stellar labels, to Keck High Resolution Echelle
Spectrometer (HIRES) spectra of 141 cool ($\lt$5200 K) stars from the
California Planet Search. Our implementation is capable of predicting
labels for small ($\lt$1 $R\_{\odot}$) stars of spectral types K and
later with accuracies of 68 K in effective temperature ($T\_{eff}$), 5\%
in stellar radius ($R\_{*}$), and 0.08 dex in bulk metallicity ([Fe/H]),
and maintains this performance at low spectral resolutions ($R$ $\lt$
5000). As M-dwarfs are the focus of many future planet-detection
surveys, this work can aid efforts to better characterize the cool star
population and uncover correlations between cool star abundances and
planet occurrence for constraining planet formation theories.

evidence for those precursor structures in the present distribution of
halo stars. Confirmation that this process is continuing came with the
discovery of the Saggittarius dwarf galaxy, which is being disrupted by
the Milky Way, but direct evidence that this process provided the bulk

Here we show that about ten per cent of the metal-poor stars in the halo

single coherent structure that was disrupted during or soon after the
Galaxy's formation. This object had a highly inclined orbit about the

compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellar halos
formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmological
context by analyzing the simulations in the same way as the SDSS data.
While the masses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the
simulated stellar halos show considerable scatter, the properties and
degree of substructure in the Milky Way's halo match well the properties
of a ``typical'' stellar halo built exclusively out of the debris from
disrupted satellite galaxies. Our results therefore point toward a
picture in which an important fraction of the stellar halo of the Milky
Way has been accreted from satellite galaxies.

	Abstract = {{Recent observations have revealed streams of gas and stars in the halo
of the Milky Way that are the debris from interactions between our
Galaxy and some of its dwarf companion galaxies; the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy and the Magellanic clouds. Analysis of the material has shown
that much of the halo is made up of cannibalized satellite galaxies, and
that dark matter is distributed nearly spherically in the Milky Way. It
remains unclear, however, whether cannibalized substructures are as
common in the haloes of galaxies as predicted by galaxy-formation
theory. Here we report the discovery of a giant stream of metal-rich
stars within the halo of the nearest large galaxy, M31 (the Andromeda
galaxy). The source of this stream could be the dwarf galaxies M32 and
NGC205, which are close companions of M31 and which may have lost a
substantial number of stars owing to tidal interactions. The results
demonstrate that the epoch of galaxy building still continues, albeit at
a modest rate, and that tidal streams may be a generic feature of galaxy
haloes.

	Abstract = {{The halo of M31 shows a wealth of substructures, some of which are
consistent with assembly from satellite accretion. Here we report on
kinematic and abundance results from Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy in the
near-infrared calcium triplet region of over 3500 red giant star
candidates along the minor axis and in off-axis spheroid fields of M31.
These data reach out to large radial distances of about 160 kpc. The
derived radial velocity distributions show an indication of a
kinematically cold substructure around \~{}17 kpc, which has been reported
before. We devise a new and improved method to measure spectroscopic
metallicities from the calcium triplet in low signal-to-noise ratio
spectra using a weighted co-addition of the individual lines. The
resulting distribution (accurate to \~{}0.3 dex down to signal-to-noise
ratios of 5) leads us to note an even stronger gradient in the abundance
distribution along M31's minor axis and in particular toward the outer
halo fields than previously detected. The mean metallicity in the outer
fields reaches below -2 dex, with individual values as low as
lesssim-2.6 dex. This is the first time such a metal-poor halo has been
detected in M31. In the fields toward the inner spheroid, we find a
sharp decline of \~{}0.5 dex in metallicity in a region at \~{}20 kpc, which
roughly coincides with the edge of an extended disk, previously detected
from star count maps. A large fraction of red giants that we detect in
the most distant fields are likely members of M33's overlapping halo. A
comparison of our velocities with those predicted by new N-body
simulations argues that the event responsible for the Giant Stream is
most likely not responsible for the full population of the inner halo.
We show further that the abundance distribution of the Stream is
different from that of the inner halo, from which it becomes evident, in
turn, that the merger event that formed the Stream and the outer halo
cannot have contributed any significant material to the inner spheroid.
All these severe structure changes in the halo suggest a high degree of
infall and stochastic abundance accretion governing the buildup of M31's
inner and outer halo.

Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the

	Abstract = {{The Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy is the only galaxy of this type that
shows clearly episodic star formation separated by long pauses. Here we
present metallicities for 437 radial velocity members of this Galactic
satellite. The metallicities and radial velocities were measured as part
of a Large Programme with the Very Large Telescope at the European
Southern Observatory, Chile. We obtained medium-resolution spectroscopy
with the multiobject spectrograph FLAMES. Our target red giants cover
the entire projected surface area of Carina. Our spectra are centered at
the near-infrared Ca II triplet, which is a well-established metallicity
indicator for old and intermediate-age red giants. The resulting data
sample provides the largest collection of spectroscopically derived
metallicities for a Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxy to date. Four of
our likely radial velocity members of Carina lie outside this galaxy's
nominal tidal radius, supporting earlier claims of the possible
existence of such stars beyond the main body of Carina. We find a mean
metallicity of [Fe/H]\~{}-1.7 dex on the 1997 metallicity scale of Carretta
and Gratton for Carina. The formal FWHM of the metallicity distribution
function is 0.92 dex, while the full range of metallicities is found to
span approximately -3.0 dex$\lt$[Fe/H]$\lt$0.0 dex. The metallicity
distribution function might be indicative of several subpopulations
distinct in metallicity. There appears to be a mild radial gradient such
that more metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated,
matching a similar trend for an increasing fraction of intermediate-age
stars (see the 2001 work of Harbeck and coworkers). This, as well as the
photometric colors of the more metal-rich red giants, suggests that
Carina exhibits an age-metallicity relation. Indeed, the age-metallicity
degeneracy seems to conspire to form a narrow red giant branch despite
the considerable spread in metallicity and wide range of ages. The
metallicity distribution function is not well matched by a simple
closed-box model of chemical evolution. Qualitatively better matches are
obtained by chemical models that also take into account infall and
outflows. A G dwarf problem remains for all these models.

Methods: Estimates, using semi-analytical methods and numerical
simulations of the motion of dust grains in a collapsing non-magnetic
and non-rotating gas sphere with a central light source are made in
order to model possible dust-cleansing effects. <BR /> Results: Our
calculations indicate that the amount of cleansed material may well be
consistent with the abundance differences observed for the Sun when
compared with solar-like stars and with the relations found between
these differences and the condensation temperature of the element. <BR
/> Conclusions: It seems quite possible that the proposed mechanism
produced the significant abundance effects observed for the Sun,
provided that late and relatively weak accretion did occur. The effects
of cleansing may, however, be affected by outflows from the Sun, the
existence and dynamics of magnetic fields and of the accretion disk, and
the possible presence and location of the early Sun in a rich stellar

	Abstract = {{High-resolution images of the solar surface show a granulation pattern
of hot rising and cooler downward-sinking material - the top of the
deep-reaching solar convection zone. Convection plays a role for the
thermal structure of the solar interior and the dynamo acting there, for
the stratification of the photosphere, where most of the visible light
is emitted, as well as for the energy budget of the spectacular
processes in the chromosphere and corona. Convective stellar atmospheres
can be modeled by numerically solving the coupled equations of
(magneto)hydrodynamics and non-local radiation transport in the presence
of a gravity field. The CO5BOLD code described in this article is
designed for so-called ``realistic'' simulations that take into account
the detailed microphysics under the conditions in solar or stellar
surface layers (equation-of-state and optical properties of the matter).
These simulations indeed deserve the label ``realistic'' because they
reproduce the various observables very well - with only minor
differences between different implementations. The agreement with
observations has improved over time and the simulations are now
well-established and have been performed for a number of stars. Still,
severe challenges are encountered when it comes to extending these
simulations to include ideally the entire star or substellar object: the
strong stratification leads to completely different conditions in the
interior, the photosphere, and the corona. Simulations have to cover
spatial scales from the sub-granular level to the stellar diameter and
time scales from photospheric wave travel times to stellar rotation or
dynamo cycle periods. Various non-equilibrium processes have to be taken
into account. Last but not least, realistic simulations are based on
detailed microphysics and depend on the quality of the input data, which
can be the actual accuracy limiter. This article provides an overview of
the physical problem and the numerical solution and the capabilities of
CO5BOLD, illustrated with a number of applications.

	Abstract = {A few minutes after the Big Bang that created our Universe, nucleosynthesis reactions forged some lighter isotopes, including 7Li. Ever since then, such reactions have taken place in the hot stellar interiors, providing the stars with the energy to shine and forming all chemical elements necessary for life as we know it. In this thesis I describe how we have inferred the chemical composition of stars in a globular cluster, hosting one of the oldest stellar populations in our Galaxy, in order to address two fundamental astrophysical problems.

The first problem is related to lithium, and the prediction of its primordial abundance from present cosmological theories of how the Universe was born. The Li abundances that we measure in the envelopes of globular cluster stars are lower than this estimate and we investigate the possibility that Li has been drained from the stellar surfaces. This thesis presents observational evidence that low-mass stars experience a small increase in their surface Li abundances during the course of their late phases of evolution, supporting this hypothesis.

The second question is related to the formation and evolution of globular clusters. It appears that these dense stellar environments early underwent a unique form of self- enrichment, by retaining the gas outflow from slow stellar winds. The material was then incorporated into a second stellar generation with identical chemical signatures to the first, except for a handful of lighter elements, including sodium. I here discuss several aspects of this stellar pollution process.

Only with a correct physical description of the radiative and convective energy transport through the stellar atmosphere, and the equilibrium state of the atoms, ions and molecules that form the tenuous gas, can we make solid predictions of the emergent spectrum and derive accurate abundances. In particular, I discuss how the simplifying assumption of local thermal equilibrium give rise to systematic errors in the analysis of Li and Na spectral lines, commonly mis-estimating the elemental abundances in stars by 10?50\%, and in certain cases considerably more. Moreover, we have for the first time investigated the combined influence from departures from local thermal equilibrium and hydro-static equilibrium in the determination of the solar Na abundance.},

	Abstract = {{One triggering mechanism suggested for supernovae involves the collapse
of a degenerate core due to electron captures. Barkat et al. (1974)
showed that an eight solar mass star develops a degenerate core after
nonexplosive carbon burning. Miyaji et al. (1980) performed
hydrodynamical calculations regarding a degenerate O + Ne + Mg core. It
was found that electron captures on Mg-24 and Ne-20 trigger the collapse
of the core prior to the initiation of explosive oxygen burning. In the
present investigation the gravitational contraction of hypothetical pure
neon stars is discussed in order to clarify the effect of electron
degeneracy on neon ignition and stellar evolution, which is crucial for
8-10 solar mass stars. A summary is provided of the evolution from
helium burning through the phase of the developing O + Ne + Mg core.
Attention is given to neon ignition, the origin of hydrogen-deficient
carbon stars, and the evolution toward supernova stages, and possible
formation of white dwarfs.

	Abstract = {{The merger of two neutron stars is predicted to give rise to three major
detectable phenomena: a short burst of {$\gamma$}-rays, a
gravitational-wave signal, and a transient optical-near-infrared
source powered by the synthesis of large amounts of very heavy elements
via rapid neutron capture (the r-process). Such transients, named
{\lsquo}macronovae{\rsquo} or {\lsquo}kilonovae{\rsquo}, are believed to be
centres of production of rare elements such as gold and platinum. The
most compelling evidence so far for a kilonova was a very faint
near-infrared rebrightening in the afterglow of a short {$\gamma$}-ray
burst at redshift z{\thinsp}={\thinsp}0.356, although findings indicating
bluer events have been reported. Here we report the spectral
identification and describe the physical properties of a bright kilonova
associated with the gravitational-wave source GW170817 and {$\gamma$}-ray
burst GRB 170817A associated with a galaxy at a distance of 40
megaparsecs from Earth. Using a series of spectra from ground-based
observatories covering the wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the
near-infrared, we find that the kilonova is characterized by rapidly
expanding ejecta with spectral features similar to those predicted by
current models. The ejecta is optically thick early on, with a velocity
of about 0.2 times light speed, and reaches a radius of about 50
astronomical units in only 1.5 days. As the ejecta expands, broad
absorption-like lines appear on the spectral continuum, indicating
atomic species produced by nucleosynthesis that occurs in the
post-merger fast-moving dynamical ejecta and in two slower (0.05 times
light speed) wind regions. Comparison with spectral models suggests that
the merger ejected 0.03 to 0.05 solar masses of material, including
high-opacity lanthanides.

	Abstract = {{We calculate the Type Ia supernova (SN) rate for different star
formation histories in galaxies by adopting the most popular and recent
progenitor models. We show that the timescale for the maximum in the SN
Ia rate, which corresponds also to time of the maximum enrichment, is
not unique but is a strong function of the adopted stellar lifetimes,
initial mass function, and star formation rate. This timescale varies
from \~{}40-50 Myr for an instantaneous starburst to \~{}0.3 Gyr for a typical
elliptical galaxy to \~{}4.0-5.0 Gyr for a disk of a spiral galaxy like the
Milky Way. We also show that the typical timescale of 1 Gyr, often
quoted as the typical timescale for the SNe Ia, is just the time at
which, in the solar neighborhood, the Fe production from SNe Ia starts
to become important and not the time at which SNe Ia start to explode.
As a consequence of this, a change in slope in the [O/Fe] ratio is
expected in correspondence of this timescale. We conclude that the
suggested lack of SNe Ia at low metallicities produces results at
variance with the observed [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation in the solar
region. We also compute the SN Ia rates for different galaxies as a
function of redshift and predict an extended maximum between redshift
z\~{}3.6 and z\~{}1.6 for elliptical galaxies, and two maxima, one at z\~{}3 and
the other at z\~{}1, for spiral galaxies, under the assumption that
galaxies start forming stars at z$_{f}$\~{}5 and
{$\Omega$}$_{M}$=0.3, {$\Omega$}$_{Lambda}$=0.7.

the main sequence to the stage of helium exhaustion in the core. Out of
the total time elapsed, two-thirds is spent near the main sequence with
hydrogen burning in the core and one-fourth is spent in the red-giant
region with helium burning in the core combined with hydrogen burning in
a shell. During the hydrogen-burning phase near the main sequence, C'2
is converted into N'4 and Li is destroyed over a large fraction of the
stellar interior. 016 is slowly converted into N'4 in the core. During
the rise toward the red-giant tip immediately preceding the ignition of
helium in the core, the extension of a convection envelope almost to the
hydrogen- burning shell then leads to an increase in the surface ratio
of N14 to C32 by a factor of 3.2 and to a decrease in the surface
abundance of Li by a factor of 60. Surface abundances do not change
further during core helium burning. Comparison with the surface Li
abundance of Capella F and G permits an inference concerning the average
rate of mass loss from the surface of a 3 Mo star.

can thus be maintained. This leads to a natural explanation of the large

	Abstract = {{The lithium problem arises from the significant discrepancy between the
primordial $^{7}$Li abundance as predicted by big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN) theory and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) baryon density, and the pre-Galactic lithium abundance
inferred from observations of metal-poor (Population II) stars. This
problem has loomed for the past decade, with a persistent discrepancy of
a factor of 2-3 in $^{7}$Li/H. Recent developments have sharpened
all aspects of the Li problem. Namely: (1) BBN theory predictions have
sharpened due to new nuclear data; in particular, the uncertainty on the
reaction rate for$^{3}$He({$\alpha$},{$\gamma$})$^{7}$Be has
reduced to 7.4\%, nearly a factor of 2 tighter than previous
determinations. (2) The WMAP five-year data set now yields a cosmic
baryon density with an uncertainty reduced to 2.7\%. (3) Observations of
metal-poor stars have tested for systematic effects. With these, we now
find that the BBN+WMAP predicts$^{7}$Li/H =
(5.24$_{-0.67}$$^{+0.71}$) {\times} 10$^{-10}$. The
central value represents an increase by 23\%, most of which is due to the
upward shift in the$^{3}$He({$\alpha$},{$\gamma$})$^{7}$Be rate.
More significant is the reduction in the$^{7}$Li/H uncertainty by
almost a factor of 2, tracking the reduction in
the$^{3}$He({$\alpha$},{$\gamma$})$^{7}$Be error bar. These
changes exacerbate the Li problem; the discrepancy is now a factor 2.4
or 4.2{$\sigma$} (from globular cluster stars) to 4.3 or 5.3{$\sigma$} (from
halo field stars). Possible resolutions to the lithium problem are
briefly reviewed, and key experimental and astronomical measurements
highlighted.

	Abstract = {{Checking stellar yields with galactic chemical evolution models is an
important test of stellar nucleosynthesis simulations. This is generally
done by applying a very simple galactic model with a large number of
free parameters. It is, however, at least questionable whether such a
model can serve as a dependable test of stellar nucleosynthesis. A
self-consistent galactic model, on the other hand, can be used to
determine yields that are consistent with the galactic chemical
evolution. The chemodynamical model introduced in this paper includes a
detailed description of the stellar metal-dependent enrichment and
serves to determine the chemical yields of massive stars. It shows that
the metal dependency of stellar nucleosynthesis, gas flows in the
galaxy, mixing processes in the interstellar medium, and the energy
release of supernovae (SNe) have a great influence on the distribution
of chemical elements. From the chemodynamical model and the observed
evolution of [{$\alpha$}/Fe], I find that on average, one out of 195
intermediate-mass stars explodes as a SN of Type Ia. This yields a ratio
of Type Ia SN to Type II + Ib SN of 1:8.5. Furthermore, the model
predicts present SN rates in our Galaxy for Types Ia and II + Ib of
1/107 yr and 1/41 yr, respectively. I present Galactic yields of 23
different chemical elements from C to Ni. One important result is that
the yields of Cr, Fe, and Ni are a factor of 2 too high, and odd-z
element yields are systematically underestimated in the nucleosynthesis
models of massive stars. A comparison of the stellar with the Galactic
yields suggests that the lower mass limit for stars to become Type II
SNe may be 11 M$_{&sun;}$, and that the core collapse of stars
more massive than 30-40 M$_{&sun;}$ produces a black hole. The
model predicts 1.2-1.5 {\times} 10$^{9}$ stellar remnants of
massive stars (neutron stars and black holes) in our Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{The nucleosynthetic yield of isotopes lighter than A = 66 (zinc) is
determined for a grid of stellar masses and metallicities including
stars of 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 30, 35, and 40
M$_{sun}$ and metallicities Z = 0, l0$^{-4}$, 0.01, 0.1, and
1 times solar (a slightly reduced mass grid is employed for nonsolar
metallicities). Altogether 78 different model supernova explosions are
calculated. In each case nucleosynthesis has already been determined for
200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the presupernova star,
including the effects of time dependent convection. Here each star is
exploded using a piston to give a specified final kinetic energy at
infinity (typically 1.2 {\times} 10$^{51}$ ergs), and the explosive
modifications to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects of neutrino
irradiation, determined. A single value of the critical
$^{12}$C({$\alpha$},{$\gamma$}) $^{16}$O reaction rate
corresponding to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations.
The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its sensitivity to
model parameters. In each case, the final mass of the collapsed remnant
is also determined and often found not to correspond to the location of
the piston (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a ``mass cut''
farther out. This mass cut is sensitive not only to the explosion
energy, but also to the presupernova structure, stellar mass, and the
metallicity. Unless the explosion mechanism, for unknown reasons,
provides a much larger characteristic energy in more massive stars, it
appears likely that stars larger than about 30 M$_{sun}$ will
experience considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the
initial launch of a successful shock.  While such explosions will
produce a viable, bright Type II supernova light curve, lacking perhaps
the radioactive tail, they will have dramatically reduced yields of
heavy elements and may leave black hole remnants of up to 10 and more
solar masses. The production of black holes may be particularly favored
for stars of low metallicity, both because of their more compact
structure and reduced mass loss.

	Abstract = {{Some of the heavy elements, such as gold and europium (Eu), are almost
exclusively formed by the rapid neutron capture process (r-process).
However, it is still unclear which astrophysical site between
core-collapse supernovae and neutron star-neutron star
(NS-NS) mergers produced most of the r-process elements in the
universe. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models can test these
scenarios by quantifying the frequency and yields required to reproduce
the amount of europium (Eu) observed in galaxies. Although NS-NS
mergers have become popular candidates, their required frequency (or
rate) needs to be consistent with that obtained from gravitational wave
measurements. Here, we address the first NS-NS merger detected by
LIGO/Virgo (GW170817) and its associated gamma-ray burst and analyze
their implication for the origin of r-process elements. The range of
NS-NS merger rate densities of 320-4740
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ provided by LIGO/Virgo is
remarkably consistent with the range required by GCE to explain the Eu
abundances in the Milky Way with NS-NS mergers, assuming the solar
r-process abundance pattern for the ejecta. Under the same assumption,
this event has produced about 1-5 Earth masses of Eu, and
3-13 Earth masses of gold. When using theoretical calculations to
derive Eu yields, constraining the role of NS-NS mergers becomes
more challenging because of nuclear astrophysics uncertainties. This is
the first study that directly combines nuclear physics uncertainties
with GCE calculations. If GW170817 is a representative event,
NS-NS mergers can produce Eu in sufficient amounts and are likely
to be the main r-process site.

low-[Mg/Fe] stars only. In the intermediate-metallicity range of
{\minus}1.1 $\lt$ [M/H] $\lt$ {\minus}0.7, a [Mg/Fe] gradient is detected
for stars at | Z| =10$\{$--$\}$30 $\{$kpc$\}$ and it flattens out at | Z| $\gt$ 30
$\{$kpc$\}$. The l {\minus} V $_{los}$ diagram is adopted to separate
halo stars from the disk by defining the transition metallicity, which
is of [M/H] {\sim} {\minus}1.1 {\plusmn} 0.05 dex for the high-[Mg/Fe]
sequence and of [M/H] {\sim} {\minus}0.7 {\plusmn} 0.05 dex for the

the in situ halo at {\minus}1.6 $\lt$ [M/H] $\lt$ {\minus}1.1, have a cutoff
at R {\sim} 15 kpc and | Z| {\sim} 10 $\{$kpc$\}$, beyond which low-[Mg/Fe] halo
stars are the main contributions. In the metallicity range of {\minus}1.6
$\lt$ [M/H] $\lt$ {\minus}0.7, there is a negative metallicity gradient for
the high-[Mg/Fe] halo at | Z| $\lt$ 8$\{$--$\}$10 $\{$kpc$\}$, while only a marginal
or no slope in the [M/H] versus | Z|  diagram for the low-[Mg/Fe] halo
at | Z| $\lt$ 8$\{$--$\}$10 $\{$kpc$\}$, beyond which both the high-[Mg/Fe] halo and

indicate a complicated formation history of the Galaxy and we may see a
hint of a three-section halo, i.e., the inner in situ halo within | Z|
{\sim} 8$\{$--$\}$10 $\{$kpc$\}$, the intermediately outer dual-mode halo at | Z|

study were obtained at five observatories, and analyzed in a uniform
manner. We have determined abundances of representative light
proton-capture, {$\alpha$}, Fe-peak and neutron-capture element groups. Our
aim is to better understand the peculiar chemical enrichment history of
this cluster, in which two stellar groups are characterized by a
different content in iron, neutron capture elements Y, Zr and Ba, and
{$\alpha$} element Ca. The principal results of this study are: (i)
substantial star-to-star metallicity scatter (- 2.0 {\lsim} [Fe/H] {\lsim}
-1.6); (ii) enhancement of s-process/r-process neutron-capture abundance
ratios in a fraction of giants, positively correlated with metallicity;
(iii) sharp separation between the s-process-rich and s-process-poor
groups by [La/Eu] ratio; (iv) possible increase of [Cu/Fe] ratios with
increasing [Fe/H], suggesting that this element also has a significant
s-process component; and (v)presence of Na-O and C-N anticorrelations in
both the stellar groups.

	Abstract = {{We use high-precision photometry of red-giant-branch (RGB) stars in 57
Galactic globular clusters (GCs), mostly from the `Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) UV Legacy Survey of Galactic GCs', to identify and
characterize their multiple stellar populations. For each cluster the
pseudo-two-colour diagram (or `chromosome map') is presented, built with
a suitable combination of stellar magnitudes in the F275W, F336W, F438W,
and F814W filters that maximizes the separation between multiple
populations. In the chromosome map of most GCs (type-I clusters), stars
separate in two distinct groups that we identify with the first (1G) and
the second generation (2G). This identification is further supported by
noticing that 1G stars have primordial (oxygen-rich, sodium-poor)
chemical composition, whereas 2G stars are enhanced in sodium and
depleted in oxygen. This 1G-2G separation is not possible for a few GCs
where the two sequences have apparently merged into an extended,
continuous sequence. In some GCs (type-II clusters) the 1G and/or the 2G
sequences appear to be split, hence displaying more complex chromosome
maps. These clusters exhibit multiple subgiant branches (SGBs) also in
purely optical colour-magnitude diagrams, with the fainter SGB joining
into a red RGB which is populated by stars with enhanced heavy-element
abundance. We measure the RGB width by using appropriate colours and
pseudo-colours. When the metallicity dependence is removed, the RGB
width correlates with the cluster mass. The fraction of 1G stars ranges
from {\tilde}8 per cent to {\tilde}67 per cent and anticorrelates with the
cluster mass, indicating that incidence and complexity of the multiple
population phenomenon both increase with cluster mass.

some Globular Clusters.  <BR />Methods: The data have been collected
with FLAMES+UVES, the multi-fiber high resolution facility at the
ESO/VLT@UT2 telescope. Analysis was performed under LTE approximation
for the following elements: O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Ba,
and NLTE corrections were applied to those (Na, Mg) strongly affected by
departure from LTE. Spectroscopic data were coupled with high-precision
wide-field UBVIC photometry from WFI@2.2 m telescope and infrared JHK
photometry from 2MASS.  <BR />Results: We derived an average [Fe/H] =
-1.07{\plusmn}0.01 (internal error), and an {$\alpha$} enhancement of
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] = +0.39{\plusmn}0.05 dex (internal error). We confirm the
presence of an extended Na-O anticorrelation, and find two distinct
groups of stars with significantly different Na and O content. We find
no evidence of a Mg-Al anticorrelation. By coupling our results with
previous studies on the CN band strength, we find that the CN strong
stars have higher Na and Al content and are more O depleted than the CN
weak ones. The two groups of Na-rich, CN-strong and Na-poor, CN-weak
stars populate two different regions along the RGB. The Na-rich group
defines a narrow sequence on the red side of the RGB, while the Na-poor
sample populate a bluer, more spread portion of the RGB. In the $\{$U$\}$ vs.
$\{$U-B$\}$ color magnitude diagram the RGB spread is present from the base of
the RGB to the RGB-tip. Apparently, both spectroscopic and photometric
results imply the presence of two stellar populations in M 4. We briefly
discuss the possible origin of these populations.

	Abstract = {{We present abundances of Fe, Na, and O for 1409 red giant stars in 15
galactic globular clusters (GCs), derived from the homogeneous analysis
of high-resolution FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra. Combining the present data
with results from our FLAMES/UVES spectra and from previous studies
within the project, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19
clusters, the largest and most homogeneous database of this kind to
date. The programme clusters cover a range in metallicity from [Fe/H] =
-2.4 dex to [Fe/H] = -0.4 dex, with a wide variety of global parameters
(morphology of the horizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc.). For
all clusters we find the Na-O anticorrelation, the classical signature
of the operation of proton-capture reactions in H-burning at high
temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars that are now
extinct. Using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension
of the Na-O anticorrelation), we can define three different components
of the stellar population in GCs. We separate a primordial component (P)
of first-generation stars, and two components of second-generation
stars, that we name intermediate (I) and extreme (E) populations from
their different chemical composition. The P component is present in all
clusters, and its fraction is almost constant at about one third. The I
component represents the bulk of the cluster population. On the other
hand, E component is not present in all clusters, and it is more
conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive clusters. We
discuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in
our sample and in two additional clusters (M 3 = NGC 5272 and M 13 =
NGC6205) with large sets of stars analysed in the literature. We also
find that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum O
and maximum Na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change
that is represented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity
and luminosity. This second dependence suggests a correlation between
average mass of polluters and cluster mass.

and high signal-to-noise spectra of 21 red giant branch (RGB) stars in
the globular cluster NGC 6752 are presented. We demonstrate that the
Str{\"o}mgren c$_{1}$ index correlates extremely well with the
measured NH, CH and CN indices and that variations in c$_{1}$ are
due to differences in UV NH band strengths. As shown by Grundahl et al.
($\backslash$cite$\{$grundahl02$\}$), the RGB stars in all 20 globular clusters surveyed
possess large star-to-star variations in their c$_{1}$ index,
which we interpret as significant inhomogeneities in N abundances. The
well known relations among O and Na and Mg and Al as well as with CN,
CH, and NH are also present in these stars, some of which are fainter
than the RGB bump. We find that the Li (6708 {\AA}) equivalent width
becomes too small to be measured as the luminosity of the stars increase
above the luminosity of the RGB bump. Taken together, these data enforce
the results of Gratton et al. ($\backslash$cite$\{$gratton01$\}$) for turnoff and
sub-giant branch stars, and suggest that in this cluster the abundance
correlations observed among the brighter giants are in place prior to
appreciable RGB ascent and likely due to previous generation(s) of
stars, rather than due to mixing in the observed stars. Based on

Tuc, only sodium shows any enhancement (by about 0.4 dex) in the

evolution of low-mass stars, these abundance enhancements in the
CN-strong stars cannot be due to mixing. They must be primordial in

during the epoch of low-mass star formation. A process by which both the
sodium and cyanogen anomalies might be produced is described.

	Abstract = {{We revise the scenario of the formation of Galactic globular clusters
(GCs) by adding the observed detailed chemical composition of their
different stellar generations to the set of their global parameters. We
exploit the unprecedented set of homogeneous abundances of more than
1200 red giants in 19 clusters, as well as additional data from
literature, to give a new definition of bona fide GCs, as the stellar
aggregates showing the Na-O anticorrelation. We propose a classification
of GCs according to their kinematics and location in the Galaxy in three
populations: disk/bulge, inner halo, and outer halo. We find that the
luminosity function of GCs is fairly independent of their population,
suggesting that it is imprinted by the formation mechanism only
marginally affected by the ensuing evolution. We show that a large
fraction of the primordial population should have been lost by the
proto-GCs. The extremely low Al abundances found for the primordial
population of massive GCs indicate a very fast enrichment process before
the formation of the primordial population. We suggest a scenario for
the formation of GCs that includes at least three main phases: i) the
formation of a precursor population (likely due to the interaction of
cosmological structures similar to those that led to the formation of
dwarf spheroidals, but residing at smaller Galactocentric distances,
with the early Galaxy or with other structures); ii) the triggering of a
long episode of star formation (the primordial population) from the
precursor population; and iii) the formation of the current GC, mainly
within a cooling flow formed by the slow winds of a fraction of the
primordial population. The precursor population is very effective in
raising the metal content in massive and/or metal-poor (mainly halo)
clusters, while its r{\^o}le is minor in small and/or metal-rich
(mainly disk) ones. Finally, we use principal component analysis and
multivariate relations to study the phase of metal enrichment from first
to second generation. We conclude that most of the chemical signatures
of GCs may be ascribed to a few parameters, the most important being
metallicity, mass, and cluster age. Location within the Galaxy (as
described by the kinematics) also plays some r{\^o}le, while
additional parameters are required to describe their dynamical status.

that M54 shows intrinsic metallicity dispersion, \~{}0.19 dex rms. (2) When
the stars of the Sgr nucleus are included, the metallicity distribution
strongly resembles that in {$\omega$} Cen; the relative contribution of the

In both globular clusters (GCs) there is a very extended Na-O
anticorrelation, which is a signature of different stellar generations
born within the cluster. (4) The metal-poor and metal-rich components in
M54 (and {$\omega$} Cen) show clearly distinct extension of the Na-O
anticorrelation, the most heavily polluted stars being those of the
metal-rich component. We propose a tentative scenario for cluster
formation that could explain these features. Finally, similarities and
differences found in the two most massive GCs in our Galaxy can be
easily explained if they are similar objects (nuclear clusters in dwarf

from any dynamical modelling approach, and we implement an analytic King

mass estimate, which accounts explicitly for the discrete nature of the
data for individual stars, the varying error bars for proper motions of
differing signal-to-noise ratio, and for data incompleteness. Both of
these two methods are evaluated for their practicality and are shown to
provide an unbiased and robust estimate of the cluster mass. We apply
these approaches to the enigmatic globular cluster {$\omega$} Centauri,
combining the proper motion from van Leeuwen et al. with improved
photometric cluster membership probabilities. We show that all mass
estimates based on spherical isotropic models yield (4.55 {\plusmn} 0.1)
{\times} 10$^{6}$ M$_{&sun;}$[D/5.5 {\plusmn} 0.2
kpc]$^{3}$, where our modelling allows us to show how the
statistical precision of this estimate improves as more proper motion
data of lower signal-to-noise ratio are included. MLM predictions, based
on an anisotropic axisymmetric Jeans model, indicate for {$\omega$} Cen
that the inclusion of anisotropies is not important for the mass
estimates, but that accounting for the flattening is: flattened models
imply (4.05 {\plusmn} 0.1) {\times} 10$^{6}$ M$_{&sun;}$[D/5.5
{\plusmn} 0.2 kpc]$^{3}$, 10 per cent lower than when restricting
the analysis to a spherical model. The best current distance estimates
imply an additional uncertainty in the mass estimate of 12 per cent.

	Abstract = {{Globular clusters (GCs) exhibit star-to-star variations in specific
elements (e.g., He, C, N, O, Na, Al) that bear the hallmark of
high-temperature H-burning. These abundance variations can be observed
spectroscopically and also photometrically, with the appropriate choice
of filters, due to the changing of spectral features within the band
pass. This phenomenon is observed in nearly all of the ancient GCs,
although, to date, it has not been found in any massive cluster younger
than 2 Gyr. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain this
phenomenon, with most invoking multiple epochs of star formation within
the cluster; however, all have failed to reproduce various key
observations, in particular when a global view of the GC population is
taken. We review the state of current observations and outline the
successes and failures of each of the main proposed models. The
traditional idea of using the stellar ejecta from a first generation of
stars to form a second generation of stars, while conceptually
straightforward, has failed to reproduce an increasing number of
observational constraints. We conclude that the puzzle of multiple
populations remains unsolved, hence alternative theories are needed.

not simple stellar populations, but rather are made up of multiple
generations. Evidence stems both from photometry and spectroscopy. A new
paradigm is arising for the formation of massive star clusters, which
includes several episodes of star formation. While this provides an
explanation for several features of globular clusters, including the
second-parameter problem, it also opens new perspectives on the relation
between globular clusters and the halo of our Galaxy, and by extension
on all populations with a high specific frequency of globular clusters,
such as, e.g., giant elliptical galaxies. We review progress in this
area, focussing on the most recent studies. Several points remain to
become properly understood, in particular those concerning the nature of
the polluters producing the abundance pattern in the clusters and the
typical timescale, the range of cluster masses where this phenomenon is
active, and the relation between globular clusters and other satellites
of our Galaxy.

change in paradigm thanks to the discovery of large amounts of
substructure, especially in the outer halo. I discuss the implications

of large wide field photometric and spectroscopic surveys, and
especially in the era of Gaia.

	Abstract = {{We present the metallicity distribution function (MDF) for 24,270 G and
16,847 K dwarfs at distances from 0.2 to 2.3 kpc from the Galactic
plane, based on spectroscopy from the Sloan Extension for Galactic
Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey. This stellar sample is
significantly larger in both number and volume than previous
spectroscopic analyses, which were limited to the solar vicinity, making
it ideal for comparison with local volume-limited samples and Galactic
models. For the first time, we have corrected the MDF for the various
observational biases introduced by the SEGUE target-selection strategy.
SEGUE is particularly notable for its sample of K dwarfs, which are too
faint to examine spectroscopically far from the solar neighborhood. The
MDF of both spectral types becomes more metal-poor with increasing |Z|,
which reflects the transition from a sample with small [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
values at small heights to one with enhanced [{$\alpha$}/Fe] above 1 kpc.
Comparison of our SEGUE distributions to those of two different Milky
Way models reveals that both are more metal-rich than our observed
distributions at all heights above the plane. Our unbiased observations
of G and K dwarfs provide valuable constraints over the |Z|-height range
of the Milky Way disk for chemical and dynamical Galaxy evolution
models, previously only calibrated to the solar neighborhood, with
particular utility for thin- and thick-disk formation models.

	Abstract = {{We examine the kinematics of the Galactic halo based on SDSS/SEGUE data
by Carollo et al. We find that their claims of a counter-rotating halo
are the result of substantial biases in distance estimates (of the order
of 50 per cent): the claimed retrograde component, which makes up only a
tiny fraction of the entire sample, prone to contaminations, is
identified as the tail of distance overestimates. The strong
overestimates also result in a lift in the vertical velocity component,
which explains the large altitudes those objects were claimed to reach.
Errors are worst for the lowest metallicity stars, which explains the
metal-poor nature of the artificial component. We also argue that
measurement errors were not properly accounted for and that the use of
Gaussian fitting on intrinsically non-Gaussian Galactic components
invokes the identification of components that are distorted or even
artificial. Our evaluation of the data leads to a revision of the
estimated velocity ellipsoids and does not yield any reliable evidence
for a counter-rotating halo component. If a distinct counter-rotating
halo component exists, then it must be far weaker than claimed by
Carollo et al. Finally, we note that their revised analysis presented in
Beers et al. does not alleviate our main concerns.

	Abstract = {{The structure and kinematics of the recognized stellar components of the
Milky Way are explored, based on well-determined atmospheric parameters
and kinematic quantities for 32360 ``calibration stars'' from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and its first extension, SDSS-II, which
included the sub-survey Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and
Exploration (SEGUE). Full space motions for a sub-sample of 16,920
stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpc of the Sun, are used to
derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- and outer-halo components of
the Galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-disk and proposed
metal-weak thick-disk (MWTD) populations. This new sample of calibration
stars represents an increase of 60\% relative to the numbers used in a
previous analysis. We first examine the question of whether the data
require the presence of at least a two-component halo in order to
account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the local
volume, and whether more than two components are needed. We also address
the question of whether the proposed MWTD is kinematically and
chemically distinct from the canonical thick disk, and point out that
the Galactocentric rotational velocity inferred for the MWTD, as well as
its mean metallicity, appear quite similar to the values derived
previously for the Monoceros stream, suggesting a possible association
between these structures. In addition, we consider the fractions of each
component required to understand the nature of the observed kinematic
behavior of the stellar populations of the Galaxy as a function of
distance from the plane. Scale lengths and scale heights for the
thick-disk and MWTD components are determined. Spatial density profiles
for the inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a Jeans
theorem analysis. The full set of calibration stars (including those
outside the local volume) is used to test for the expected changes in
the observed stellar metallicity distribution function with distance
above the Galactic plane in situ, due to the changing contributions from
the underlying stellar populations. The above issues are considered, in
concert with theoretical and observational constraints from other
Milky-Way-like galaxies, in light of modern cold dark matter galaxy
formation models.

	Abstract = {{We determined the age of the stellar content of the Galactic halo by
considering main-sequence turn-off stars. From the large number of halo
stars provided by Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we could accurately detect
the turn-off as a function of metallicity of the youngest dominant
population, which was done by looking at the hottest (bluest) stars of a
population. Using the turn-off temperature of a population of a given
metallicity, we looked for the isochrones with that turn-off temperature
and metallicity and found no age gradient as a function of metallicity.
This would mean that this dominating population of the Galactic halo
formed rapidly, probably during the collapse of the proto-Galactic gas.
Moreover, we could find a significant number of stars with hotter
temperatures than the turn-off, which might be blue horizontal branch
(BHB) stars, blue stragglers, or main sequence stars that are younger
than the dominant population and were probably formed in external
galaxies and accreted later on to our Milky Way. Motivated by the
current debate about the efficiency of gravitational settling (atomic
diffusion) in the interior of old solar-type stars, we used isochrones
with and without settling to determine the ages. When ignoring diffusion
in the isochrones we obtained ages of 14-16 Gyr. This result is a strong
argument against inhibited diffusion in old halo field stars, since it
results in a serious conflict with the age of the Universe of 13.7 Gyr.
The age obtained including diffusion in the isochrones was 10-12 Gyr,
which agrees with the absolute age of the old globular clusters in the
inner halo.

	Abstract = {{We report medium-resolution (1-2 {\AA}) spectroscopy and broadband
(UBV) photometry for a sample of 39 bright stars (the majority of which
are likely to be giants) selected as metal-deficient candidates from an
objective-prism survey concentrating on Galactic latitudes below
|b|=30{\deg}, the Luminous Stars Extension (LSE) survey of Drilling {\amp}
Bergeron. Although the primary purpose of the LSE survey was to select
OB stars (hence the concentration on low latitudes), the small number of
bright metal-deficient giant candidates noted during this survey provide
interesting information on the metal-weak thick disk (MWTD) population.
Metal abundance estimates are obtained from several different techniques
and calibrations, including some that make use of the available
photometry and spectroscopy and others that use only the spectroscopy;
these methods produce abundance estimates that are consistent with one
another and should be secure. All of the targets in our study have
available high-quality proper motions from the Hipparcos or Tycho II
catalogs, or both, that we combine with radial velocities from our
spectroscopy to obtain full space motions for the entire sample. The
rotational (V$_{phi}$) velocities of the LSE giants indicate
the presence of a rapidly rotating population, even at quite low
metallicity. We consider the distribution of orbital eccentricity of the
LSE giants as a function of [Fe/H] and conclude that the local fraction
(i.e., within 1 kpc from the Sun) of metal-poor stars that might be
associated with the MWTD is on the order of 30\%-40\% at abundances below
[Fe/H]=-1.0. Contrary to recent analyses of previous (much larger)
samples of nonkinematically selected metal-poor stars (assembled
primarily from prism surveys that concentrated on latitudes above
|b|=30{\deg}), we find that this relatively high fraction of local
metal-poor stars associated with the MWTD may extend to metallicities
below [Fe/H]=-1.6, much lower than had been considered before. We
identify a subsample of 11 LSE stars that are very likely to be members
of the MWTD, based on their derived kinematics; the lowest metallicity
among these stars is [Fe/H]=-2.35. Implications of these results for the
origin of the MWTD and for the formation of the Galaxy are considered.

chemical evolution of the Galaxy. We report on radial abundance
gradients of Fe, Ni, Ca, Si, and Mg obtained from a sample of 304
red-giant members of 29 disk open clusters, mostly concentrated at
galactocentric distances between {\tilde} 8-15 kpc, but including two
open clusters in the outer disk. The observations are from the APOGEE
survey. The chemical abundances were derived automatically by the ASPCAP
pipeline and these are part of the SDSS III Data Release 12. The
gradients, obtained from least squares fits to the data, are relatively
flat, with slopes ranging from -0.026 to -0.033 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for
the {$\alpha$}-elements [O/H], [Ca/H], [Si/H], and [Mg/H], and -0.035 dex
kpc$^{-1}$ and -0.040 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for [Fe/H] and [Ni/H],
respectively. Our results are not at odds with the possibility that
metallicity ([Fe/H]) gradients are steeper in the inner disk
($\{$R\_GC{\tilde} 7$\}$-12 kpc) and flatter towards the outer disk. The open
cluster sample studied spans a significant range in age. When breaking
the sample into age bins, there is some indication that the younger open
cluster population in our sample (log age $\lt$ 8.7) has a flatter
metallicity gradient when compared with the gradients obtained from
older open clusters.

	Abstract = {{Context. Determination and calibration of the ages of stars, which
heavily rely on stellar evolutionary models, are very challenging, while
representing a crucial aspect in many astrophysical areas. <BR /> Aims:
We describe the methodologies that, taking advantage of Gaia-DR1 and the
Gaia-ESO Survey data, enable the comparison of observed open star
cluster sequences with stellar evolutionary models. The final, long-term
goal is the exploitation of open clusters as age calibrators. <BR />
Methods: We perform a homogeneous analysis of eight open clusters using
the Gaia-DR1 TGAS catalogue for bright members and information from the
Gaia-ESO Survey for fainter stars. Cluster membership probabilities for
the Gaia-ESO Survey targets are derived based on several spectroscopic
tracers. The Gaia-ESO Survey also provides the cluster chemical
composition. We obtain cluster parallaxes using two methods. The first
one relies on the astrometric selection of a sample of bona fide
members, while the other one fits the parallax distribution of a larger
sample of TGAS sources. Ages and reddening values are recovered through
a Bayesian analysis using the 2MASS magnitudes and three sets of
standard models. Lithium depletion boundary (LDB) ages are also
determined using literature observations and the same models employed
for the Bayesian analysis. <BR /> Results: For all but one cluster,
parallaxes derived by us agree with those presented in Gaia
Collaboration (2017, A{\amp}A, 601, A19), while a discrepancy is found
for NGC 2516; we provide evidence supporting our own determination.
Inferred cluster ages are robust against models and are generally
consistent with literature values. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematic
parallax errors inherent in the Gaia DR1 data presently limit the
precision of our results. Nevertheless, we have been able to place these
eight clusters onto the same age scale for the first time, with good
agreement between isochronal and LDB ages where there is overlap. Our
approach appears promising and demonstrates the potential of combining
Gaia and ground-based spectroscopic datasets.

abundance analysis reveals that the Galactic disk, halo, and bulge

an important role in chemical evolution and that supernovae come in many
flavors with a range of element yields. The 300-fold dispersion in heavy

mixing of ejecta from individual supernova, with vastly different
yields, in clouds of {approximately} 10^6 M{center dot}. The composition

Analysis of the fossil record in old stars nearby is complementary to

breaking degeneracies inherent in analysis limited to integrated spectra

resolved stellar populations is illustrated by the constraints that are

	Abstract = {{Context. Radial velocity surveys such as the RAdial Velocity Experiment
(RAVE) provide us with measurements of hundreds of thousands of nearby
stars most of which belong to the Galactic thin, thick disk or halo.
Ideally, to study the Galactic disks (both thin and thick) one should
make use of the multi-dimensional phase-space and the whole pattern of
chemical abundances of their stellar populations. <BR /> Aims: In this
paper, with the aid of the RAVE survey, we study the thin and thick
disks of the Milky Way, focusing on the latter. We present a technique
to disentangle the stellar content of the two disks based on the
kinematics and other stellar parameters such as the surface gravity of
the stars. Using the Padova Galaxy model, we checked the ability of our
method to correctly isolate the thick disk component from the Galaxy
mixture of stellar populations. <BR /> Methods: We introduce selection
criteria in order to clean the observed radial velocities from the
Galactic differential rotation and to take into account the partial sky
coverage of RAVE. We developed a numerical technique to statistically
disentangle thin and thick disks from their mixture. <BR /> Results: We
deduce the components of the solar motion relative to the local standard
of rest (LSR) in the radial and vertical direction, the rotational lag
of the thick disk component relative to the LSR, and the square root of
the absolute value of the velocity dispersion tensor for the thick disk
alone. The analysis of the thin disk is presented in another paper. We
find good agreement with previous independent parameter determinations.
In our analysis we used photometrically determined distances. In the
Appendix we show that similar values can be found for the thick disk

	Abstract = {{We present a simple method for fitting parametrized mass models of the
Milky Way to observational constraints. We take a Bayesian approach
which allows us to take into account input from photometric and
kinematic data, and expectations from theoretical modelling. This
provides us with a best-fitting model, which is a suitable starting
point for dynamical modelling. We also determine a probability density
function on the properties of the model, which demonstrates that the
mass distribution of the Galaxy remains very uncertain. For our choices
of parametrization and constraints, we find disc scalelengths of 3.00
{\plusmn} 0.22 and 3.29 {\plusmn} 0.56 kpc for the thin and thick discs,
respectively, a solar radius of 8.29 {\plusmn} 0.16 kpc and a circular
speed at the Sun of 239 {\plusmn} 5 km s$^{-1}$, a total stellar
mass of 6.43 {\plusmn} 0.63 {\times} 10$^{10}$ M$_{&sun;}$, a
virial mass of 1.26 {\plusmn} 0.24 {\times} 10$^{12}$

parameters of our models (for example, between the disc scalelengths and
the solar radius), which we discuss. The chosen disc scaleheights are
shown to have little effect on the key properties of the model.

	Abstract = {{We present a detailed determination and analysis of 3D stellar mass
distribution of the Galactic disk for mono-age populations using a
sample of 0.93 million main-sequence turnoff and subgiant stars from the
LAMOST Galactic Surveys. Our results show the following. (1) All stellar
populations younger than 10 Gyr exhibit strong disk flaring, which is
accompanied by a dumpy vertical density profile that is best described
by a sech$^{ n }$ function with index depending on both radius and
age. (2) Asymmetries and wave-like oscillations are presented in both
the radial and vertical direction, with strength varying with stellar
populations. (3) As a contribution by the Local spiral arm, the midplane
stellar mass density at solar radius but 400{\ndash}800 pc
(3{\deg}{\ndash}6{\deg}) away from the Sun in the azimuthal direction has a
value of 0.0594 {\plusmn} 0.0008 M $_{&sun;}$
pc$^{-3}$, which is 0.0164 M $_{&sun;}$
pc$^{-3}$ higher than previous estimates at the solar
neighborhood. The result raises doubts on the current estimate of local
dark matter density. (4) The radial distribution of surface mass density
yields a disk scale length evolving from {\sim}4 kpc for the young
populations to {\sim}2 kpc for the old populations. The overall
population exhibits a disk scale length of 2.48 {\plusmn} 0.05 kpc and a
total stellar mass of (3.6 {\plusmn} 0.1) {\times} 10$^{10}$ M
$_{&sun;}$ assuming R $_{&sun;}$ = 8.0 kpc, and the value
becomes (4.1 {\plusmn} 0.1) {\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{&sun;}$ if
R $_{&sun;}$ = 8.3 kpc. (5) The disk has a peak star formation
rate (SFR) changing from 6{\ndash}8 Gyr ago at the inner part to
4{\ndash}6 Gyr ago at the outer part, indicating an inside-out assemblage
history. The 0{\ndash}1 Gyr population yields a recent disk total SFR of

@article{Noguchi1999,
	Abstract = {{A new idea is proposed for the origin of bulges in spiral galaxies.
Numerical simulations of protogalactic collapse suggest strongly that
galactic bulges have been assembled from massive clumps formed in
galactic disks in their early evolutionary phase. These clumps result
from the gravitational instability of the gas-rich disks of young
galaxies. Owing to dynamical frictions, those massive clumps, individual
masses of which can be as large as \~{}10$^{9}$ M$_{solar}$,
are able to spiral toward the galactic center within a few Gyr. Inward
transport of disk matter by this process leads to the formation of a
galactic bulge. A simple analytical model has been constructed in which
the clumpy evolution of a disk galaxy is controlled by two parameters:
the timescale with which the primordial gas in the halo accretes onto
the disk plane (i.e., the collapse timescale) and the initial mass
fraction of the gas relative to the galaxy total mass. Under plausible
assumptions for the variation of these parameters among spiral galaxies,
the clumpy evolution model can explain an observed trend in which the
bulge-to-disk ratio increases as the total mass or the internal density
of the galaxy increases. This success suggests that the clumpy evolution
of the galactic disk constitutes an important ingredient of disk galaxy
evolution. Star formation in primeval disk galaxies takes place mostly
in the clumps. The resulting knotty appearance of these systems may
explain the peculiar morphology observed in a number of high-redshift
galaxies.

@article{White1978,
	Abstract = {{A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a
role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is
that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales
arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes
and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical
dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of
nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the
virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive
halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar
gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds
up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge
into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound
cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and
acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous
galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the
masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific
assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably
well with observation.

	Abstract = {{We study the relationship between age, metallicity, and
{$\alpha$}-enhancement of FGK stars in the Galactic disk. The results are
based upon the analysis of high-resolution UVES spectra from the
Gaia-ESO large stellar survey. We explore the limitations of the
observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellar parameters and the
selection effects that are caused by the photometric target
preselection. We find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey
suppress old metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. This
suppression may be as high as 97\% in some regions of the age-metallicity
relationship. The dataset consists of 144 stars with a wide range of
ages from 0.5 Gyr to 13.5 Gyr, Galactocentric distances from 6 kpcto 9.5
kpc, and vertical distances from the plane 0 $\lt$ |Z| $\lt$ 1.5 kpc. On
this basis, we find that i) the observed age-metallicity relation is
nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 Gyr and 8 Gyr; ii) at ages
older than 9 Gyr, we see a decrease in [Fe/H] and a clear absence of
metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selection
functions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [Fe/H] at any age; and
iv) [Mg/Fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [Mg/Fe] at ages
$\gt$9 Gyr is not as small as advocated by some other studies. In
agreement with earlier work, we find that radial abundance gradients
change as a function of vertical distance from the plane. The [Mg/Fe]
gradient steepens and becomes negative. In addition, we show that the
inner disk is not only more {$\alpha$}-rich compared to the outer disk, but
also older, as traced independently by the ages and Mg abundances of
stars.

It is found that the mean metallicity of the disk increased by about a
factor of five between 12 and 5 billion years ago and has increased only
slightly since then. The star formation rate (SFR) for the disk as a
function of time is obtained from the number count data, taking into
account stellar evolution and the disk scale height corrections. The SFR
which produces a metallicity distribution for the F stars consistent
with the G dwarf data is one where the SFR has remained relatively
constant over the lifetime of the disk. It is concluded that the disk
has collapsed by about a factor of 6 perpendicular to the galactic plane
during its lifetime, most of the collapse occurring 13 to 7 billion
years ago.

	Abstract = {{We present a new approach (MADE) that generates mass, age, and distance
estimates of red giant stars from a combination of astrometric,
photometric, and spectroscopic data. The core of the approach is a
Bayesian artificial neural network (ANN) that learns from and completely
replaces stellar isochrones. The ANN is trained using a sample of red
giant stars with mass estimates from asteroseismology. A Bayesian
isochrone pipeline uses the astrometric, photometric, spectroscopic, and
asteroseismology data to determine posterior distributions for the
training outputs: mass, age, and distance. Given new inputs, posterior
predictive distributions for the outputs are computed, taking into
account both input uncertainties, and uncertainties in the ANN
parameters. We apply MADE to $\{${\tilde} $\}$10 000 red giants in the overlap
between the 14th data release from the APO Galactic Evolution Experiment
(APOGEE) and the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS). The ANN is able
to reduce the uncertainty on mass, age, and distance estimates for
training-set stars with high output uncertainties allocated through the
Bayesian isochrone pipeline. The fractional uncertainties on mass are
$\lt$ 10 per cent and on age are between 10 to 25 per cent. Moreover, the
time taken for our ANN to predict masses, ages, and distances for the
entire catalogue of APOGEE-TGAS stars is of a similar order of the time
taken by the Bayesian isochrone pipeline to run on a handful of stars.
Our resulting catalogue clearly demonstrates the expected thick- and
thin-disc components in the [M/H]-[{$\alpha$}/M] plane, when examined by
age.

	Abstract = {{The age of an individual star cannot be measured, only estimated through
mostly model-dependent or empirical methods, and no single method works
well for a broad range of stellar types or for a full range in age. This
review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating
stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their
strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they
are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because
they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open
clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar
models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual
stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is
described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even
the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as
asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide
precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve
when stressed by better observations.

	Abstract = {{We present and apply rigorous dynamical modeling with which we infer
unprecedented constraints on the stellar and dark matter mass
distribution within our Milky Way (MW), based on large sets of
phase-space data on individual stars. Specifically, we model the
dynamics of 16,269 G-type dwarfs from SEGUE, which sample 5 kpc $\lt$
R$_{GC}$ $\lt$ 12 kpc and 0.3 kpc $\lt$\~{} |Z| $\lt$\~{} 3 kpc. We
independently fit a parameterized MW potential and a three-integral,
action-based distribution function (DF) to the phase-space data of 43
separate abundance-selected sub-populations (MAPs), accounting for the
complex selection effects affecting the data. We robustly measure the
total surface density within 1.1 kpc of the mid-plane to 5\% over 4.5 kpc
$\lt$ R$_{GC}$ $\lt$ 9 kpc. Using metal-poor MAPs with small radial
scale lengths as dynamical tracers probes 4.5 kpc $\lt$\~{} R$_{GC}$
$\lt$\~{} 7 kpc, while MAPs with longer radial scale lengths sample 7 kpc
$\lt$\~{} R$_{GC}$ $\lt$\~{} 9 kpc. We measure the mass-weighted Galactic
disk scale length to be R$_{d}$ = 2.15 {\plusmn} 0.14 kpc, in
agreement with the photometrically inferred spatial distribution of
stellar mass. We thereby measure dynamically the mass of the Galactic
stellar disk to unprecedented accuracy: M $_{*}$ = 4.6 {\plusmn}

{\plusmn} 4 M $_{&sun;}$ pc$^{-2}$ is contributed by
stars and stellar remnants. By combining our surface density
measurements with the terminal velocity curve, we find that the MW's
disk is maximal in the sense that V $_{ c, disk}$/V $_{ c,

constrain for the first time the radial profile of the dark halo at such
small Galactocentric radii, finding that {$\rho$}$_{DM}$(r {\ap}R

	Abstract = {{We review the available methods for estimating actions, angles and
frequencies of orbits in both axisymmetric and triaxial potentials. The
methods are separated into two classes. Unless an orbit has been trapped
by a resonance, convergent, or iterative, methods are able to recover
the actions to arbitrarily high accuracy given sufficient computing
time. Faster non-convergent methods rely on the potential being
sufficiently close to a separable potential, and the accuracy of the
action estimate cannot be improved through further computation. We
critically compare the accuracy of the methods and the required
computation time for a range of orbits in an axisymmetric multicomponent
Galactic potential. We introduce a new method for estimating actions
that builds on the adiabatic approximation of Sch{\"o}nrich {\amp}
Binney and discuss the accuracy required for the actions, angles and
frequencies using suitable distribution functions for the thin and thick
discs, the stellar halo and a star stream. We conclude that for studies
of the disc and smooth halo component of the Milky Way, the most
suitable compromise between speed and accuracy is the St{\"a}ckel
Fudge, whilst when studying streams the non-convergent methods do not
offer sufficient accuracy and the most suitable method is computing the
actions from an orbit integration via a generating function. All the

	Abstract = {{We extend models of our Galaxy based on distribution functions that are
analytic functions of the action integrals to extended distribution
functions (EDFs), which have an analytic dependence on metallicity as
well. We use a simple, but physically motivated, functional forms for
the metallicity of the interstellar medium as a function of radius and
time and for the star formation rate, and a model for the diffusion of
stars through phase space to suggest the required functional form of an
EDF. We introduce a simple prescription for radial migration that
preserves the overall profile of the disc while allowing individual
stars to migrate throughout the disc. Our models explicitly consider the
thin and thick discs as two distinct components separated in age. We
show how an EDF can be used to incorporate realistic selection functions
in models, and to construct mock catalogues of observed samples. We show
that the selection function of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS) biases
in favour of young stars, which have atypically small random velocities.
With the selection function taken into account our models produce good
fits of the GCS data in chemo-dynamical space and the Gilmore {\amp} Reid
(1983) density data. From our EDF, we predict the structure of the Sloan
Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration G-dwarf sample. The
kinematics are successfully predicted. The predicted metallicity
distribution has too few stars with [Fe/H] {\sime} -0.5 dex and too many
metal-rich stars. A significant problem may be the lack of any
chemical-kinematic correlations in our thick disc. We argue that EDFs
will prove essential tools for the analysis of both observational data
and sophisticated models of Galaxy formation and evolution.

	Abstract = {{Stars near the Sun oscillate both horizontally and vertically. In a
previous paper by Binney it was assumed that the coupling between these
motions can be modelled by determining the horizontal motion without
reference to the vertical motion, and recovering the coupling between
the motions by assuming that the vertical action is adiabatically
conserved as the star oscillates horizontally. Here, we show that,
although the assumption of adiabatic invariance works well, more
accurate results can be obtained by taking the vertical action into
account when calculating the horizontal motion. We use orbital tori to
present a simple but fairly realistic model of the Galaxy's discs in
which the motion of stars is handled rigorously, without decomposing it
into horizontal and vertical components. We examine the ability of the
adiabatic approximation to calculate the model's observables, and find
that it performs perfectly in the plane, but errs slightly away from the
plane. When the new correction to the adiabatic approximation is used,
the density, mean-streaming velocity and velocity dispersions are in
error by less than 10 per cent for distances up to 2.5 kpc from the Sun.
The torus-based model reveals that at locations above the plane, the
long axis of the velocity ellipsoid points almost to the Galactic
centre, even though the model potential is significantly flattened. This
result contradicts the widespread belief that the shape of the Galaxy's
potential can be strongly constrained by the orientation of velocity
ellipsoid near the Sun. An analysis of individual orbits reveals that in
a general potential the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid depends on
the structure of the model's distribution function as much as on its
gravitational potential, contrary to what is the case for St{\"a}ckel
potentials. We argue that the adiabatic approximation will provide a
valuable complement to torus-based models in the interpretation of
current surveys of the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{Using the photometric parallax method we estimate the distances to \~{}48
million stars detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and map
their three-dimensional number density distribution in the Galaxy. The
currently available data sample the distance range from 100 pc to 20 kpc
and cover 6500 deg$^{2}$ of sky, mostly at high Galactic latitudes
(|b| $\gt$ 25). These stellar number density maps allow an investigation
of the Galactic structure with no a priori assumptions about the
functional form of its components. The data show strong evidence for a
Galaxy consisting of an oblate halo, a disk component, and a number of
localized overdensities. The number density distribution of stars as
traced by M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (D $\lt$ 2 kpc) is well fit
by two exponential disks (the thin and thick disk) with scale heights
and lengths, bias corrected for an assumed 35\% binary fraction, of
H$_{1}$ = 300 pc and L$_{1}$ = 2600 pc, and H$_{2}$ =
900 pc and L$_{2}$ = 3600 pc, and local thick-to-thin disk density
normalization
{$\rho$}$_{thick}$(R$_{&sun;}$)/{$\rho$}$_{thin}$(R$_{&sun;}$)
= 12\% . We use the stars near main-sequence turnoff to measure the shape
of the Galactic halo. We find a strong preference for oblate halo
models, with best-fit axis ratio c/a = 0.64, {$\rho$}$_{H}$ propto
r$^{-2.8}$ power-law profile, and the local halo-to-thin disk
normalization of 0.5\%. Based on a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we
estimate the errors of derived model parameters not to be larger than
\~{}20\% for the disk scales and \~{}10\% for the density normalization, with
largest contributions to error coming from the uncertainty in
calibration of the photometric parallax relation and poorly constrained
binary fraction. While generally consistent with the above model, the
measured density distribution shows a number of statistically
significant localized deviations. In addition to known features, such as
the Monoceros stream, we detect two overdensities in the thick disk
region at cylindrical galactocentric radii and heights (R,Z) \~{} (6.5,1.5)
kpc and (R,Z) \~{} (9.5,0.8) kpc and a remarkable density enhancement in
the halo covering over 1000 deg$^{2}$ of sky toward the
constellation of Virgo, at distances of \~{}6-20 kpc. Compared to counts in
a region symmetric with respect to the l = 0{\deg} line and with the same
Galactic latitude, the Virgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of
2 number density excess and may be a nearby tidal stream or a
low-surface brightness dwarf galaxy merging with the Milky Way. The u -
g color distribution of stars associated with it implies metallicity
lower than that of thick disk stars and consistent with the halo
metallicity distribution. After removal of the resolved overdensities,
the remaining data are consistent with a smooth density distribution; we
detect no evidence of further unresolved clumpy substructure at scales
ranging from \~{}50 pc in the disk to \~{}1-2 kpc in the halo.

functions are generalized to represent the axisymmetric potential and
density of models in which the mass is no longer confined to a single
plane. These pairs of functions include some that vary continuously from
Kuzmin's (1956) thin-disk model to Plummer's (1911) spherical model for
globular clusters. The models are free from singularities and involve
functions that are quite explicit and elementary. Even without
superposing any of them, the present density laws seem to simulate

	Abstract = {{We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium
density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering
universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape,
independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum,
and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged
equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a
simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy
clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology,
the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its
characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are
significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that
reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic
density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the
universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this
assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for
all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with
previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good
agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on
the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles
to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.

Way with the highest precision to date across Galactocentric distances

phase-space coordinates of {\gsim}23,000 luminous red giant stars, for
which we previously determined precise parallaxes using a data-driven
model that combines spectral data from APOGEE with photometric
information from WISE, 2MASS, and Gaia. We derive the circular velocity
curve with the Jeans equation assuming an axisymmetric gravitational
potential. At the location of the Sun we determine the circular velocity
with its formal uncertainty to be v$_{c}$(R$_{&sun;

uncertainties at the {\sim}2\%{\ndash}5\% level. We find that the velocity
curve is gently but significantly declining at ({\minus}1.7 {\plusmn} 0.1)
km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, with a systematic
uncertainty of 0.46 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$,
beyond the inner 5 kpc. We exclude the inner 5 kpc from our analysis due
to the presence of the Galactic bar, which strongly influences the
kinematic structure and requires modeling in a nonaxisymmetric
potential. Combining our results with external measurements of the mass
distribution for the baryonic components of the Milky Way from other
studies, we estimate the Galaxy{\rsquo}s dark halo mass within the virial
radius to be M$_{vir}$ = (7.25+/- 0.26)$\backslash$cdot 10$^{11}$

	Abstract = {{The highly elliptical, 16-year-period orbit of the star S2 around the
massive black hole candidate Sgr A* is a sensitive probe of the
gravitational field in the Galactic centre. Near pericentre at 120 AU
{\ap} 1400 Schwarzschild radii, the star has an orbital speed of {\ap}7650
km s$^{-1}$, such that the first-order effects of Special and
General Relativity have now become detectable with current capabilities.
Over the past 26 years, we have monitored the radial velocity and motion
on the sky of S2, mainly with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics
instruments on the ESO Very Large Telescope, and since 2016 and leading
up to the pericentre approach in May 2018, with the four-telescope
interferometric beam-combiner instrument GRAVITY. From data up to and
including pericentre, we robustly detect the combined gravitational
redshift and relativistic transverse Doppler effect for S2 of z =
{$\Delta$}{$\lambda$} / {$\lambda$} {\ap} 200 km s$^{-1}$/c with different
statistical analysis methods. When parameterising the post-Newtonian
contribution from these effects by a factor f , with f = 0 and f = 1
corresponding to the Newtonian and general relativistic limits,
respectively, we find from posterior fitting with different weighting
schemes f = 0.90 {\plusmn} 0.09|$_{stat}$ {\plusmn}
0.15|$_{sys}$. The S2 data are inconsistent with pure Newtonian
dynamics.

This paper is dedicated to Tal Alexander, who passed away about a week
before the pericentre approach of S2.

selected by ESO as a third generation instrument for the Very Large
Telescope (VLT). The grasp of the large collecting area offered by the
VLT (8.2m diameter), combined with the large multiplex and wavelength
coverage (optical to near-IR: 0.8{$\mu$}m - 1.8{$\mu$}m) of MOONS will provide
the European astronomical community with a powerful, unique instrument
able to pioneer a wide range of Galactic, Extragalactic and Cosmological
studies and provide crucial follow-up for major facilities such as Gaia,
VISTA, Euclid and LSST. MOONS has the observational power needed to
unveil galaxy formation and evolution over the entire history of the
Universe, from stars in our Milky Way, through the redshift desert, and
up to the epoch of very first galaxies and re-ionization of the Universe
at redshift z$\gt$8-9, just few million years after the Big Bang. On a
timescale of 5 years of observations, MOONS will provide high quality
spectra for $\gt$3M stars in our Galaxy and the local group, and for 1-2M
galaxies at z$\gt$1 (SDSS-like survey), promising to revolutionise our
understanding of the Universe. The baseline design consists of \~{}1000
fibers deployable over a field of view of \~{}500 square arcmin, the
largest patrol field offered by the Nasmyth focus at the VLT. The total
wavelength coverage is 0.8{$\mu$}m-1.8{$\mu$}m and two resolution modes:
medium resolution and high resolution. In the medium resolution mode
(R\~{}4,000-6,000) the entire wavelength range 0.8{$\mu$}m-1.8{$\mu$}m is
observed simultaneously, while the high resolution mode covers
simultaneously three selected spectral regions: one around the CaII
triplet (at R\~{}8,000) to measure radial velocities, and two regions at
R\~{}20,000 one in the J-band and one in the H-band, for detailed
measurements of chemical abundances.

	Abstract = {{DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based
dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions
with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. To trace the
underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be
selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red
galaxies up to $z=1.0$. To probe the Universe out to even higher
redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to
$z=1.7$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the
underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ($ 2.1 \lt
z \lt 3.5$), for the Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorption features in their
spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral
hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint
targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited
Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a
median $z\approx 0.2$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar
redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the
matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.

across a wavelength range of 0.36-1.8mum, with dynamical fiber
positioning that allows fibers to match the exposure times of individual

and sensitivity by collecting millions of spectra per year down to
limiting magnitudes of g \~{} 20-24 mag, with a nominal velocity precision
of \~{}100 m/s in high-resolution mode. This white paper describes science
cases for stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science using MSE,
including the discovery and atmospheric characterization of exoplanets
and substellar objects, stellar physics with star clusters,
asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators and opacity-driven pulsators,
studies of stellar rotation, activity, and multiplicity, as well as the
chemical characterization of AGB and extremely metal-poor stars.

	Abstract = {{We present the Pristine survey, a new narrow-band photometric survey
focused on the metallicity-sensitive Ca H{\amp}K lines and conducted in
the Northern hemisphere with the wide-field imager MegaCam on the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. This paper reviews our overall survey
strategy and discusses the data processing and metallicity calibration.
Additionally we review the application of these data to the main aims of
the survey, which are to gather a large sample of the most metal-poor
stars in the Galaxy, to further characterize the faintest Milky Way
satellites, and to map the (metal-poor) substructure in the Galactic
halo. The current Pristine footprint comprises over 1000 deg$^{2}$
in the Galactic halo ranging from b {\tilde} 30{\deg} to {\tilde}78{\deg}
and covers many known stellar substructures. We demonstrate that, for
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) stellar objects, we can calibrate the
photometry at the 0.02-mag level. The comparison with existing
spectroscopic metallicities from SDSS/Sloan Extension for Galactic
Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object
Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope shows that, when combined with SDSS
broad-band g and I photometry, we can use the CaHK photometry to infer
photometric metallicities with an accuracy of {\tilde}0.2 dex from [Fe/H]
= -0.5 down to the extremely metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] $\lt$ -3.0). After
the removal of various contaminants, we can efficiently select
metal-poor stars and build a very complete sample with high purity. The
success rate of uncovering [Fe/H]$_{SEGUE}$ $\lt$ -3.0 stars among
[Fe/H]$_{Pristine}$ $\lt$ -3.0 selected stars is 24 per cent, and
85 per cent of the remaining candidates are still very metal poor
([Fe/H]$\lt$-2.0). We further demonstrate that Pristine is well suited to
identify the very rare and pristine Galactic stars with [Fe/H] $\lt$
-4.0, which can teach us valuable lessons about the early Universe.

	Abstract = {{To better understand the origin and evolution of the Milky Way bulge, we
have conducted a survey of bulge red giant branch and clump stars using
the HERMES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We targeted
ARGOS survey stars with pre-determined bulge memberships, covering the
full metallicity distribution function. The spectra have signal-to-noise
ratios comparable to, and were analysed using the same methods as the
GALAH survey. In this work, we present the survey design, stellar
parameters, distribution of metallicity and alpha-element abundances
along the minor bulge axis at latitudes $b$ = $-10^{\circ},
-7.5^{\circ}$ and $-5^{\circ}$. Our analysis of ARGOS stars indicates
that the centroids of ARGOS metallicity components should be located
$\approx$0.09 dex closer together. The vertical distribution of
$\alpha$-element abundances is consistent with the varying contributions
of the different metallicity components. Closer to the plane, alpha
abundance ratios are lower as the metal-rich population dominates. At
higher latitudes, the alpha abundance ratios increase as the number of
metal-poor stars increases. However, we find that the trend of
alpha-enrichment with respect to metallicity is independent of latitude.
Comparison of our results with those of GALAH DR2 revealed that for
[Fe/H] $\approx -0.8$, the bulge shares the same abundance trend as the
high-$\alpha$ disk population. However, the metal-poor bulge population
([Fe/H] $\lesssim -0.8$) show enhanced alpha abundance ratios compared
to the disk/halo. These observations point to fairly rapid chemical
evolution in the bulge, and that the metal-poor bulge population does
not share the same similarity with the disk as the more metal-rich
populations.

	Abstract = {{The past decade and a half has seen the design and execution of several
ground-based spectroscopic surveys, both Galactic and Extragalactic.
Additionally, new surveys are being designed that extend the boundaries
of current surveys. In this context, many important considerations must
be done when designing a spectrograph for the future. Among these is the
determination of the optimum wavelength coverage. In this work, we
present a new code for determining the wavelength ranges that provide
the optimal amount of information to achieve the required science goals
for a given survey. In its first mode, it utilizes a user-defined list
of spectral features to compute a figure-of-merit for different spectral
configurations. The second mode utilizes a set of flux-calibrated
spectra, determining the spectral regions that show the largest
differences among the spectra. Our algorithm is easily adaptable for any
set of science requirements and any spectrograph design. We apply the
algorithm to several examples, including 4MOST, showing the method
yields important design constraints to the wavelength regions.

science cases in terms of provisional plans for a 300-night Subaru
survey. We describe plans to constrain the nature of dark energy via a
survey of emission line galaxies spanning a comoving volume of 9.3
h$^{-3}$ Gpc$^{3}$ in the redshift range 0.8 $\lt$ z $\lt$
2.4. In each of six redshift bins, the cosmological distances will be
measured to 3\% precision via the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale,
and redshift-space distortion measures will constrain structure growth
to 6\% precision. In the near-field cosmology program, radial velocities
and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way and M 31 will be used
to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies and the
structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for
10$^{6}$ stars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo, and tidal streams
as faint as V {\tilde} 22, including stars with V $\lt$ 20 to complement
the goals of the Gaia mission. A medium-resolution mode with R = 5000 to
be implemented in the red arm will allow the measurement of multiple
{$\alpha$}-element abundances and more precise velocities for Galactic
stars. For the galaxy evolution program, our simulations suggest the
wide wavelength range of PFS will be powerful in probing the galaxy
population and its clustering over a wide redshift range. We plan to
conduct a color-selected survey of 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2 galaxies and AGN over
16 deg$^{2}$ to J {\sime} 23.4, yielding a fair sample of galaxies
with stellar masses above {\tilde}10$^{10}$ M$_{&sun;}$ at z
{\sime} 2. A two-tiered survey of higher redshift Lyman break galaxies
and Lyman alpha emitters will quantify the properties of early systems
close to the reionization epoch.

	Abstract = {{Large stellar surveys of the Milky Way require validation with reference
to a set of `benchmark' stars whose fundamental properties are well
determined. For metal-poor benchmark stars, disagreement between
spectroscopic and interferometric effective temperatures has called the
reliability of the temperature scale into question. We present new
interferometric measurements of three metal-poor benchmark stars, HD
140283, HD 122563, and HD 103095, from which we determine their
effective temperatures. The angular sizes of all the stars were
determined from observations with the PAVO beam combiner at visible
wavelengths at the CHARA array, with additional observations of HD
103095 made with the VEGA instrument, also at the CHARA array. Together
with photometrically derived bolometric fluxes, the angular diameters
give a direct measurement of the effective temperature. For HD 140283,
we find {\thetas}$_{LD}$ = 0.324 {\plusmn} 0.005 mas,
T$_{eff}$ = 5787 {\plusmn} 48 K; for HD 122563,
{\thetas}$_{LD}$ = 0.926 {\plusmn} 0.011 mas, T$_{eff}$ = 4636

0.007 mas, T$_{eff}$ = 5140 {\plusmn} 49 K. Our temperatures for HD
140283 and HD 103095 are hotter than the previous interferometric
measurements by 253 and 322 K, respectively. We find good agreement
between our temperatures and recent spectroscopic and photometric
estimates. We conclude some previous interferometric measurements have
been affected by systematic uncertainties larger than their quoted
errors.

particularly significant for the study of solar-type and red-giant
stars. These stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations, which
are excited and intrinsically damped by turbulence in the outermost
layers of the convective envelopes. In this review we discuss the
current state of the field, with a particular emphasis on recent
advances provided by the Kepler and COROT (Convection, Rotation {\amp}

	Abstract = {{We have executed a survey of nearby, main-sequence A-, F-, and G-type
stars with the CHARA Array, successfully measuring the angular diameters
of forty-four stars with an average precision of \~{}1.5\%. We present new
measures of the bolometric flux, which in turn leads to an empirical
determination of the effective temperature for the stars observed. In
addition, these CHARA-determined temperatures, radii, and luminosities
are fit to Yonsei-Yale model isochrones to constrain the masses and ages
of the stars. These results are compared to indirect estimates of these
quantities obtained by collecting photometry of the stars and applying
them to model atmospheres and evolutionary isochrones. We find that for
most cases, the models overestimate the effective temperature by
\~{}1.5\%-4\% when compared to our directly measured values. The
overestimated temperatures and underestimated radii in these works
appear to cause an additional offset in the star's surface gravity
measurements, which consequently yield higher masses and younger ages,
in particular for stars with masses greater than \~{}1.3 M
$_{&sun;}$. Additionally, we compare our measurements to a large
sample of eclipsing binary stars, and excellent agreement is seen within
both data sets. Finally, we present temperature relations with respect
to (B - V) and (V - K) colors as well as spectral type, showing that
calibration of effective temperatures with errors \~{}1\% is now possible
from interferometric angular diameters of stars.

uncertainties in the stellar parameter determinations are comparable to
the differences between the APOGEE pipeline results and those determined
independently from optical spectra. We compare StarNet to other
data-driven methods; for example, StarNet and the Cannon 2 show similar
behaviour when trained with the same data sets; however, StarNet
performs poorly on small training sets like those used by the original
Cannon. The influence of the spectral features on the stellar parameters
is examined via partial derivatives of the StarNet model results with
respect to the input spectra. While StarNet was developed using the
APOGEE observed spectra and corresponding ASSET synthetic data, we
suggest that this technique is applicable to other wavelength ranges and

	Abstract = {{In an era when spectroscopic surveys are capable of collecting spectra
for hundreds of thousands of stars, fast and efficient analysis methods
are required to maximize scientific impact. These surveys provide a
homogeneous database of stellar spectra that are ideal for machine
learning applications. One such application, StarNet, is a convolutional
neural network developed to derive stellar labels (temperature, surface
gravity, and metallicity) from both SDSS-III APOGEE and synthetic
stellar spectra. It has demonstrated excellent precision and accuracy
over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, when trained on either
observed or synthetic spectra. Though StarNet was developed using the
high-resolution (R {\tilde} 20, 000) APOGEE spectra and corresponding
ASSeT synthetic grid, we suggest that this technique is applicable to
other spectral resolutions, spectral surveys, and wavelength regimes. As
a demonstration, we present a version of StarNet trained on lower
resolution, R=6000, ASSeT synthetic spectra. This resolution was
selected to prepare for spectra delivered by Gemini/NIFS and the
forthcoming Gemini/GIRMOS instruments. Results suggest that the stellar
parameters determined from this medium-resolution StarNet version can be
comparable in precision to the high-resolution APOGEE results. This
success can be attributed to (1) a large training set of synthetic
spectra (N{\tilde}200,000) with a priori stellar labels, and (2) the use
of the entire spectrum in the solution rather than a few weighted
windows, which is common in other automated spectral analysis methods
(e.g. FERRE). Remaining challenges in our StarNet applications include
rectification, continuum normalization, and wavelength coverage. Here
with present preliminary results on the impact of imperfect continuum
rectification when compared to normalized synthetic data. Solutions to
these problems will contribute to efficient spectroscopic surveys, their
data reduction pipelines, and the precision in their post-data products
(for the planned Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer).

	Abstract = {{Deep learning with artificial neural networks is increasingly gaining
attention because of its potential for data-driven astronomy. However,
this methodology usually does not provide uncertainties and does not
deal with incompleteness and noise in the training data. In this work,
we design a neural network for high-resolution spectroscopic analysis
using APO Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) data that mimics the
methodology of standard spectroscopic analyses: stellar parameters are
determined using the full wavelength range, but individual element
abundances use censored portions of the spectrum. We train this network
with a customized objective function that deals with incomplete and
noisy training data and apply dropout variational inference to derive
uncertainties on our predictions. We determine parameters and abundances
for 18 individual elements at the $\{${\ap} $\}$ 0.03 dex level, even at low
signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate that the uncertainties returned by
our method are a realistic estimate of the precision and they
automatically blow up when inputs or outputs outside of the training set
are encountered, thus shielding users from unwanted extrapolation. By
using standard deep-learning tools for GPU acceleration, our method is
extremely fast, allowing analysis of the entire APOGEE data set of
{\ap}250 000 spectra in 10 min on a single, low-cost GPU. We release the
stellar parameters and 18 individual-element abundances with associated
uncertainty for the entire APOGEE DR14 data set. Simultaneously, we
release astroNN, a well-tested, open-source PYTHON package developed for
this work, but that is also designed to be a general package for deep
learning in astronomy. astroNN is available at

photospheric elemental abundances. Simultaneous fitting of these $\{$ N $\}$
{\tilde} 10-40 model labels to observed spectra has been deemed
unfeasible because the number of ab initio spectral model grid
calculations scales exponentially with $\{$ N $\}$. We suggest instead the
construction of a polynomial spectral model (PSM) of order $\{$ O $\}$ for the
model flux at each wavelength. Building this approximation requires a
minimum of only {\le}ft({\ge}nfrac$\{$$\}$$\{$$\}$$\{$0em$\}$$\{$$\}$$\{$$\{$ N $\}$+$\{$ O $\}$$\}$$\{$$\{$ O $\}$$\}$$\backslash$right)
calculations: e.g., a quadratic spectral model ($\{$ O $\}$=2) to fit $\{$ N $\}$=20
labels simultaneously can be constructed from as few as 231 ab initio
spectral model calculations; in practice, a somewhat larger number
({\tilde}300-1000) of randomly chosen models lead to a better
performing PSM. Such a PSM can be a good approximation only over a
portion of label space, which will vary case-by-case. Yet, taking the
APOGEE survey as an example, a single quadratic PSM provides a
remarkably good approximation to the exact ab initio spectral models
across much of this survey: for random labels within that survey the PSM
approximates the flux to within 10$^{-3}$ and recovers the
abundances to within {\tilde}0.02 dex rms of the exact models. This
enormous speed-up enables the simultaneous many-label fitting of spectra
with computationally expensive ab initio models for stellar spectra,
such as non-LTE models. A PSM also enables the simultaneous fitting of
observational parameters, such as the spectrum{\rsquo}s continuum or
line-spread function.

@article{Ting2017b,
	Abstract = {{Understanding the evolution of the Milky Way calls for the precise
abundance determination of many elements in many stars. A common
perception is that deriving more than a few elemental abundances
([Fe/H], [{$\alpha$}/Fe], perhaps [C/H], [N/H]) requires medium-to-high
spectral resolution, R {\gsim} 10,000, mostly to overcome the effects of
line blending. In a recent work, we presented an efficient and practical
way to model the full stellar spectrum, even when fitting a large number
of stellar labels simultaneously. In this paper, we quantify to what
precision the abundances of many different elements can be recovered, as
a function of spectroscopic resolution and wavelength range. In the
limit of perfect spectral models and spectral normalization, we show
that the precision of elemental abundances is nearly independent of
resolution, for a fixed exposure time and number of detector pixels;
low-resolution spectra simply afford much higher S/N per pixel and
generally larger wavelength range in a single setting. We also show that
estimates of most stellar labels are not strongly correlated with one
another once R {\gsim} 1000. Modest errors in the line-spread function,
as well as small radial velocity errors, do not affect these
conclusions, and data-driven models indicate that spectral (continuum)
normalization can be achieved well enough in practice. These results, to
be confirmed with an analysis of observed low-resolution data, open up
new possibilities for the design of large spectroscopic stellar surveys
and for the reanalysis of archival low-resolution data sets.

	Abstract = {{Stellar spectra are often modeled and fitted by interpolating within a
rectilinear grid of synthetic spectra to derive the stars{\rsquo} labels:
stellar parameters and elemental abundances. However, the number of
synthetic spectra needed for a rectilinear grid grows exponentially with
the label space dimensions, precluding the simultaneous and
self-consistent fitting of more than a few elemental abundances.
Shortcuts such as fitting subsets of labels separately can introduce
unknown systematics and do not produce correct error covariances in the
derived labels. In this paper we present a new approach{\mdash}Convex
Hull Adaptive Tessellation (chat){\mdash}which includes several new ideas
for inexpensively generating a sufficient stellar synthetic library,
using linear algebra and the concept of an adaptive, data-driven grid. A
convex hull approximates the region where the data lie in the label
space. A variety of tests with mock data sets demonstrate that chat can
reduce the number of required synthetic model calculations by three
orders of magnitude in an eight-dimensional label space. The reduction
will be even larger for higher dimensional label spaces. In chat the
computational effort increases only linearly with the number of labels
that are fit simultaneously. Around each of these grid points in the
label space an approximate synthetic spectrum can be generated through
linear expansion using a set of {\ldquo}gradient spectra{\rdquo} that
represent flux derivatives at every wavelength point with respect to all
labels. These techniques provide new opportunities to fit the full
stellar spectra from large surveys with 15-30 labels
simultaneously.

	Abstract = {{Oxygen is the most abundant {\ldquo}metal{\rdquo} element in stars and in
the cosmos. But determining oxygen abundances in stars has proven
challenging, because of the shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines
in their optical spectra as well as observational and theoretical
complications with these lines (e.g., blends, three-dimensional,
non-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al. were recently able to demonstrate
that oxygen abundances can be determined from low-resolution (R {\sime}
2000) optical spectra. Here, we investigate the physical processes that
enable such a measurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that
the strongest spectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO
atomic-molecular network but are manifested in spectral features that do
not involve oxygen. In the outer atmosphere layers, most of the carbon
is locked up in CO, and changes to the oxygen abundance directly affect
the abundances of all other carbon-bearing molecules, thereby changing
the strength of CH, CN, and C$_{2}$ features across the optical
spectrum. In deeper atmosphere layers, most of the carbon is in atomic
form, and any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the
other carbon-bearing molecules. The key physical effect enabling such
oxygen abundance measurements is that spectral features in the optical
arise from both the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions,
providing non-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at
hand, the results show that physically sound abundances measurements
need not be limited to those elements that have observable lines
themselves.

	Abstract = {{Context. For Gaia DR2, 280 million spectra collected by the Radial
Velocity Spectrometer instrument on board Gaia were processed, and
median radial velocities were derived for 9.8 million sources brighter
than G$_{RVS}$ = 12 mag. <BR /> Aims: This paper describes the
validation and properties of the median radial velocities published in
Gaia DR2. <BR /> Methods: Quality tests and filters were applied to
select those of the 9.8 million radial velocities that have the quality
to be published in Gaia DR2. The accuracy of the selected sample was
assessed with respect to ground-based catalogues. Its precision was
estimated using both ground-based catalogues and the distribution of the
Gaia radial velocity uncertainties. <BR /> Results: Gaia DR2 contains
median radial velocities for 7 224 631 stars, with T$_{eff}$ in
the range [3550, 6900] K, which successfully passed the quality tests.
The published median radial velocities provide a full-sky coverage and
are complete with respect to the astrometric data to within 77.2\% (for G
{\le} 12.5 mag). The median radial velocity residuals with respect to the
ground-based surveys vary from one catalogue to another, but do not
exceed a few 100 m s$^{-1}$. In addition, the Gaia radial
velocities show a positive trend as a function of magnitude, which
starts around G$_{RVS}$   9 mag and reaches about + 500 m
s$^{-1}$ at G$_{RVS}$ = 11.75 mag. The origin of the trend
is under investigation, with the aim to correct for it in Gaia DR3. The
overall precision, estimated from the median of the Gaia radial velocity
uncertainties, is 1.05 km s$^{-1}$. The radial velocity precision
is a function of many parameters, in particular, the magnitude and
effective temperature. For bright stars, G$_{RVS}$ {\isin} [4, 8]
mag, the precision, estimated using the full dataset, is in the range
220-350 m s$^{-1}$, which is about three to five times more
precise than the pre-launch specification of 1 km s$^{-1}$. At the
faint end, G$_{RVS}$ = 11.75 mag, the precisions for
T$_{eff}$ = 5000 and 6500 K are 1.4 and 3.7 km s$^{-1}$,
respectively.

APOGEE's half million spectra collected on $\gt$ 163 000 unique stars,
with time series information via repeat visits to each star, are being
applied to numerous problems in stellar populations, Galactic astronomy,
and stellar astrophysics. From among the early results of the APOGEE
project - which span from measurements of Galactic dynamics, to
multi-element chemical maps of the disk and bulge, new views of the
interstellar medium, explorations of stellar companions, the chemistry
of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species - I
highlight a few results that demonstrate APOGEE's unique ability to
sample and characterize the Galactic disk and bulge. Plans are now under
way for an even more ambitious successor to APOGEE: the six-year,
dual-hemisphere APOGEE-2 project. Both phases of APOGEE feature a strong
focus on targets having asteroseismological measurements from either
Kepler or $\{$CoRoT$\}$, from which it is possible to derive relatively
precise stellar ages. The combined APOGEE and APOGEE-2 databases of
stellar chemistry, dynamics and ages constitute an unusually

	Abstract = {{The quality and quantity of 6D stellar position-velocity measurements in
the second Gaia data release's radial velocity sample (DR2/RVS) allow us
to study small-scale structure in the orbit distribution of the Galactic
disc beyond the immediate Solar neighbourhood. We investigate the
distribution of orbital actions (J$_{R}$, L$_{z}$,
J$_{z}$) of {\tilde}3.9 million stars within 1.5 kpc of the Sun,
for which precise actions can be calculated from Gaia DR2 alone. In the
n(J$_{R}$, L$_{z}$) distribution, we identify at least seven
stellar overdensities at high J$_{R}$ that lie along lines of
constant slope {$\Delta$}J$_{R}$/{$\Delta$}L$_{z}$ and appear to
be present in the stellar distribution out to {\tilde}1.5 kpc at the same
location in (L$_{z}$, J$_{R}$). The known moving groups in
the (U, V) plane of the Solar neighbourhood are local manifestations of
this extended system of orbit substructure at low J$_{R}$, as
expected. The n(J$_{R}$, L$_{z}$) features are most
prominent among stars within |z| {\lsim} 500 pc from the Galactic plane
and with lower than average J$_{z}$. These features frequently
coincide with (L$_{z}$, J$_{R}$) regions of dramatic
imbalance between stars moving in and out, suggesting that stars are not
phase-mixed along orbits or on resonant orbits. Some of these
n(J$_{R}$, L$_{z}$) ridges resemble features expected from
rapid orbit diffusion along particular (J$_{R}$, L$_{z}$)
directions in the presence of various resonances. Orbital action and
angle space of stars in Gaia DR2 is therefore highly structured over kpc
scales, and appears to be very informative for modelling studies of
non-axisymmetric structure and resonances in the Galactic disc.

	Abstract = {{APOGEE is a large-scale, NIR, high-resolution (R{\tilde} 20 000)
spectroscopic survey of Galactic stars. It is one of the four
experiments in SDSS-III. Because APOGEE will observe in the H band,
where the extinction is six times smaller than in V, it will be the
first survey to pierce through Galactic dust and provide a vast, uniform
database of chemical abundances and radial velocities for stars across
all Galactic populations (bulge, disk, and halo). The survey will be
conducted with a dedicated, 300-fiber, cryogenic, spectrograph that is
being built at the University of Virginia, coupled to the ARC 2.5-m
telescope at Apache Point Observatory. APOGEE will use a significant
fraction of the SDSS-III bright time during a three-year period to
observe, at high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N$\gt$ 100), about 100 000
giant stars selected directly from 2MASS down to a typical flux limit of
H$\lt$13. The main scientific objectives of APOGEE are: (1) measuring
unbiased metallicity distributions and abundance patterns for the
different Galactic stellar populations, (2) studying the processes of
star formation, feedback, and chemical mixing in the Milky Way, (3)
surveying the dynamics of the bulge and disk, placing constraints on the
nature and influence of the Galactic bar and spiral arms, and (4) using
extensive chemodynamical data, particularly in the inner Galaxy, to
unravel its formation and evolution.

	Abstract = {{A suite of vast stellar surveys mapping the Milky Way, culminating in
the Gaia mission, is revolutionizing the empirical information about the
distribution and properties of stars in the Galactic stellar disk. We
review and lay out what analysis and modeling machinery needs to be in
place to test mechanism of disk galaxy evolution and to stringently
constrain the Galactic gravitational potential, using such Galactic
star-by-star measurements. We stress the crucial role of stellar survey
selection functions in any such modeling; and we advocate the utility of
viewing the Galactic stellar disk as made up of `mono-abundance
populations' (MAPs), both for dynamical modeling and for constraining
the Milky Way's evolutionary processes. We review recent work on the
spatial and kinematical distribution of MAPs, and point out how further
study of MAPs in the Gaia era should lead to a decisively clearer
picture of the Milky Way's dark-matter distribution and formation
history.

@article{Gaia-Collaboration2016,
	Abstract = {{Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the
EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in
2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept
was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the
payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was
selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at
its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon
system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and
payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission
started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the
scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these
goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance
of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the
mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and
findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We
summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit
operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the
data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through
the Gaia home page.

	Abstract = {{A small fraction of the halo field is made up of stars that share the
light element (Z {\le} 13) anomalies characteristic of second generation
globular cluster (GC) stars. The ejected stars shed light on the
formation of the Galactic halo by tracing the dynamical history of the
clusters, which are believed to have once been more massive. Some of
these ejected stars are expected to show strong Al enhancement at the
expense of shortage of Mg, but until now no such star has been found. We
search for outliers in the Mg and Al abundances of the few hundreds of
halo field stars observed in the first eighteen months of the Gaia-ESO
public spectroscopic survey. One halo star at the base of the red giant
branch, here referred to as 22593757-4648029 is found to have [ Mg/Fe ]
= -0.36 {\plusmn} 0.04 and [ Al/Fe ] = 0.99 {\plusmn} 0.08, which is
compatible with the most extreme ratios detected in GCs so far. We
compare the orbit of 22593757-4648029 to GCs of similar metallicity
andfind it unlikely that this star has been tidally stripped with low
ejection velocity from any of the clusters. However, both chemical and
kinematic arguments render it plausible that the star has been ejected
at high velocity from the anomalous GC {$\omega$} Centauri within the last
few billion years. We cannot rule out other progenitor GCs, because some
may have disrupted fully, and the abundance and orbital data are
inadequate for many of those that are still intact.

	Abstract = {{Context. In the era of massive spectroscopy surveys, automated stellar
parameter pipelines and their validation are extremely important for an
efficient scientific exploitation of the spectra. <BR /> Aims: We
undertake a critical and comprehensive comparison of the radial
velocities and the main stellar atmosphere parameters for stars in
common between the latest data releases from the Apache Point
Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and the Large sky Area
Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) surveys. <BR /> Methods:
APOGEE is a high-resolution (R = 22 500) spectroscopic survey with high
signal-to-noise ratio that is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). The latest data release, SDSS DR14, comprises APOGEE spectra for
263 444 stars, together with main stellar parameters and individual
abundances for up to 20 chemical species. LAMOST is a low-resolution (R
= 1800) optical spectroscopic survey also in the Northern Hemisphere,
where 4000 fibers can be allocated simultaneously. LAMOST DR3 contains 3
177 995 stars. <BR /> Results: A total of 42 420 dwarfs and giants stars
are in common between the APOGEE DR14 - LAMOST DR3 stellar catalogs. A
comparison between APOGEE and LAMOST RVs shows a clear offset of 4.54
{\plusmn} 0.03 km s$^{-1}$, with a dispersion of 5.8 km
s$^{-1}$, in the sense that APOGEE radial velocities are higher.
We observe a small offset in the effective temperatures of about 13 K,
with a scatter of 155 K. A small offset in [Fe/H] of about 0.06 dex
together with a scatter of 0.13 dex is also observed. We note that the
largest offset between the surveys occurs in the surface gravities.
Using only surface gravities in calibrated red giants from APOGEE DR14,
with which there are 24 074 stars in common, a deviation of 0.14 dex is
found with substantial scatter (0.25 dex). There are 17 482 red giant
stars in common between APOGEE DR14 and those in LAMOST tied to APOGEE
DR12 via the code called the Cannon. There is generally good agreement
between the two data-sets. However, we find that the differences in the
stellar parameters depend on effective temperature. For metal-rich
stars, a different trend for the [Fe/H] discrepancies is found.
Surprisingly, we see no correlation between the internal APOGEE DR14 -
DR12 differences in T$_{eff}$ and those in DR14 - LAMOST tied to
DR12, where a correlation should be expected since LAMOST has been
calibrated to APOGEE DR12. We find no correlation either between the
[Fe/H] discrepancies, suggesting that LAMOST/Cannon is not well coupled
to the APOGEE DR12 stellar parameter scale. An [Fe/H] dependence between
the stellar parameters in APOGEE DR12 and those in DR14 is reported. We
find a weak correlation in the differences between APOGEE DR14 - DR12
and LAMOST on DR12 surface gravity for stars hotter than 4800 K and in
the log g range between 2.0 and 2.8 dex. We do not observe an [Fe/H]
dependency in the gravity discrepancies.

	Abstract = {{We compile spectroscopic abundance data from 84 literature sources for
50 elements across 3058 stars in the solar neighborhood, within 150 pc
of the Sun, to produce the Hypatia Catalog. We evaluate the variability
of the spread in abundance measurements reported for the same star by
different surveys. We also explore the likely association of the star
within the Galactic disk, the corresponding observation and abundance
determination methods for all catalogs in Hypatia, the influence of
specific catalogs on the overall abundance trends, and the effect of
normalizing all abundances to the same solar scale. The resulting
stellar abundance determinations in the Hypatia Catalog are analyzed
only for thin-disk stars with observations that are consistent between
literature sources. As a result of our large data set, we find that the
stars in the solar neighborhood may reveal an asymmetric abundance
distribution, such that a [Fe/H]-rich group near the midplane is
deficient in Mg, Si, S, Ca, Sc II, Cr II, and Ni as compared to stars
farther from the plane. The Hypatia Catalog has a wide number of
applications, including exoplanet hosts, thick- and thin-disk stars, and
stars with different kinematic properties.

	Abstract = {{Using the Gaia data release 2 (DR2), we analyzed the distribution of
stars in the close vicinity of the Sun in the full 3D position-velocity
space. We have found no evidence of incomplete phase mixing in the
vertical direction of the disk, which could be originated by some
external events. We show that the vertical phase space spiral $Z$-$V\_z$
is produced by the well-known moving groups (MGs), mainly by
Coma-Berenices, Pleiades-Hyades and Sirius, when the statistical
characteristics (mean, median, or mode) of the azimuthal velocity
$V\_\varphi$ are used to analyze the distribution in the vertical
position-velocity plane. This result does not invoke external
perturbations and is independent on the internal dynamical mechanisms
that originate the MGs. Our conclusions counterbalance current arguments
in favor of short-lived (between 300 and 900 Myr) structures in the
solar neighborhood. Contrarily, they support the hypothesis of a longer
formation time scale (around a few Gyr) for the MGs.

	Abstract = {{The Utrecht course ``The Generation and Transport of Radiation'' teaches
basic radiative transfer to second-year students.  It is a much-expanded
version of the first chapter of Rybicki {\amp} Lightman's ``Radiative
Processes in Astrophysics''.  After this course, students understand why
intensity is measured per steradian, have an Eddington-Barbier feel for
optically thick line formation, and know that scattering upsets LTE. The
text is a computer-aided translation by Ruth Peterson of my 1992
Dutch-language course. My aim is to rewrite this course in non-computer
English and make it web-available at some time.  In the meantime, copies
of the Peterson translation are made yearly at Uppsala -- ask them, not
me.  Eventually it should become a textbook.

The Utrecht course ``Radiative Transfer in Stellar Atmospheres'' is a
30-hour course for third-year students.  It treats NLTE line formation
in plane-parallel stellar atmospheres at a level intermediate between
the books by Novotny and Boehm-Vitense, and Mihalas' ``Stellar
Atmospheres''.  After this course, students appreciate that epsilon is
small, that radiation can heat or cool, and that computers have changed
the field.  This course is web-available since 1995 and is regularly
improved -- but remains incomplete.  Eventually it should become a
textbook.

The three Utrecht exercise sets ``Stellar Spectra A: Basic Line
Formation'', ``Stellar Spectra B: LTE Line Formation'', and ``Stellar
Spectra C: NLTE Line Formation'' are IDL-based computer exercises for
first-year, second-year, and third-year students, respectively.  They
treat spectral classification, Saha-Boltzmann population statistics, the
curve of growth, the FAL-C solar atmosphere model, the role of H-minus
in the solar continuum, LTE formation of Fraunhofer lines, inversion
tactics, the Feautrier method, classical lambda iteration, and ALI
computation.  The first two sets are web-available since 1998; the third
will follow.

Acknowledgement.  Both courses owe much to previous Utrecht courses
taught by the late Kees Zwaan.  The third exercise set was developed by
Phil Judge, Mandy Hagenaar, and Thijs Krijger.

Reverse acknowledgement.  If you are a user of this free material you
might refer to this summary and so boost my citation standing.

	Abstract = {{We have discovered a new Galactic satellite galaxy in the constellation
of Sagittarius. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy subtends an angle of \~{}10
deg on the sky, lies at a distance of 24 kpc and is comparable in size
and luminosity to the largest dwarf spheroidal, Fornax. The new galaxy
has many features in common with the other eight Galactic dwarf
spheroidal systems, including an extended low-density spatial structure,
a well-populated red horizontal branch with a blue extension, and a
substantial carbon star population. In terms of stellar populations it
most closely resembles the Fornax dwarf, having a strong
intermediate-age stellar component and evidence of a metallicity spread.
Sagittarius is the nearest galaxy known and currently lies only \~{}16 kpc
from the centre of the Milky Way. Isodensity maps show it to be markedly
elongated along a direction pointing towards the Galactic Centre, and
suggest that it has been tidally distorted. The close proximity to the
Galactic Centre, the morphological appearance and the radial velocity of
140 km s\^{}-1 indicate that this system must have undergone at most very
few close orbital encounters with the Milky Way. It is currently
undergoing strong tidal disruption prior to being integrated into the
Galaxy. We find that at least some of the four globular clusters, M54,
Arp 2, Ter 7 and Ter 8, are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy, and will probably share the fate of their progenitor. The
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy was found serendipitously using a combination
of UK Schmidt Telescope sky survey plates, the APM automatic plate
measuring facility and the Anglo-Australian Telescope multifibre
spectrograph, AUTOFIB.

	Abstract = {{We use the 2MASS Second Incremental Release Point Source Catalog to
investigate the spatial distribution of young stars in the Perseus,
Orion A, Orion B, and MonR2 molecular clouds. After subtracting a
semiempirical model of the field star contamination from the observed
star counts, stellar surface density maps are used to identify compact
clusters and any stellar population found more uniformly distributed
over the molecular cloud. Each cloud contains between two and seven
clusters, with at least half of the cluster population found in a
single, rich cluster. In addition, a distributed stellar population is
inferred in the Orion A and MonR2 molecular clouds within the
uncertainties of the field star subtraction with a surface density
between 0.013 and 0.083 arcmin$^{-2}$. Sensitivity calculations
suggest, however, that the number of stars in the distributed population
may be underestimated by a factor of 2 or more if stars have been
forming with a Miller-Scalo IMF at a constant star formation rate for
longer than 10 Myr. After considering the possible evolutionary status
of the distributed population, the global star formation efficiency
implied by the sum of the distributed and cluster populations ranges
between 1\% and 9\% among the four clouds. The fraction of the total
stellar population contained in clusters for the nominal extinction
model ranges from \~{}50\% to 100\% if the distributed population is
relatively young ($\lt$10 Myr), to \~{}25\%-70\% if it is relatively old (\~{}100
Myr). The relatively high fraction of stars contained in clusters
regardless of the age of the distributed population, in conjunction with
the young ages generally inferred for embedded clusters in nearby
molecular clouds, indicates that a substantial fraction of the total
stellar population in these regions has formed within the past few
million years in dense clusters. This suggests that either the star
formation rate in each these clouds has recently peaked if one assumes
clouds have ages greater than 10 Myr or molecular clouds are younger
than typically thought if one assumes that the star formation rate has
been approximately constant in time.

	Abstract = {{We review recent work that investigates the formation of stellar
clusters, ranging in scale from globular clusters through open clusters
to the small scale aggregates of stars observed in T associations. In
all cases, recent advances in understanding have been achieved through
the use of state of the art stellar dynamical and gas dynamical
calculations, combined with the possibility of intercomparison with an
increasingly large dataset on young clusters. Among the subjects that
are highlighted are the frequency of cluster-mode star formation, the
possible relationship between cluster density and the highest stellar
mass, subclustering and the dynamical interactions that occur in compact
aggregates, such as binary star formation. We also consider how the
spectrum of stellar masses may be shaped by the process of competitive
accretion in dense environments and how cluster properties, such as mass
segregation and cluster morphology, can be used in conjunction with
numerical simulations to investigate the initial conditions for cluster
formation. Lastly, we contrast bottom-up and top-down scenarios for
cluster formation and discuss their applicability to the formation of
clusters on a range of scales.

Preliminary comparisons of results from the old and new models have shown  
differences in the energy distributions of stars cooler than 4500 K, in the 
ultraviolet energy distribution of metal-poor A-type stars, in the U-B and

	Abstract = {{Stars in open clusters are expected to share an identical abundance
pattern. Establishing the level of chemical homogeneity in a given open
cluster deserves further study as it is the basis of the concept of
chemical tagging to unravel the history of the Milky Way. M67 is
particularly interesting given its solar metallicity and age as well as
being a dense cluster environment. We conducted a strictly line-by-line
differential chemical abundance analysis of two solar twins in M67:
M67-1194 and M67-1315. Stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental
abundances were obtained with high precision using Keck/High Resolution
Echelle Spectrometer spectra. M67-1194 is essentially identical to the
Sun in terms of its stellar parameters. M67-1315 is warmer than M67-1194
by {\ap}150 K as well as slightly more metal-poor than M67-1194 by
{\ap}0.05 dex. M67-1194 is also found to have identical chemical
composition to the Sun, confirming its solar-twin nature. The abundance
ratios [X/Fe] of M67-1315 are similar to the solar abundances for
elements with atomic number Z {\le} 30, while most neutron-capture
elements are enriched by {\ap}0.05 dex, which might be attributed to
enrichment from a mixture of asymptotic giant branch ejecta and
r-process material. The distinct chemical abundances for the
neutron-capture elements in M67-1315 and the lower metallicity of this
star compared to M67-1194, indicate that the stars in M67 are likely not
chemically homogeneous. This poses a challenge for the concept of
chemical tagging since it is based on the assumption of stars forming in
the same star-forming aggregate.

@article{Bovy2016b,
	Abstract = {{Determining the level of chemical homogeneity in open clusters is of
fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming
clouds and that of the Galactic disk. Yet limiting the initial abundance
spread in clusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining
consistent spectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without
reference to any specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a
homogeneous cluster is that it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with
any differences between members due to variations in stellar mass and
observational uncertainties. I present a novel method for investigating
the abundance spread in open clusters that tests this one-dimensional
hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra, rather than
constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as is traditionally
done. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC
6819, and NGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional
sequences for each cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the
spectra and Approximate Bayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on
the initial abundance spread of 15 elements: $\lt$0.01 (0.02) $\{$dex$\}$ for C
and Fe, {\lsim}0.015 (0.03) $\{$dex$\}$ for N, O, Mg, Si, and Ni, {\lsim}0.02
(0.03) $\{$dex$\}$ for Al, Ca, and Mn, and {\lsim}0.03 (0.05) $\{$dex$\}$ for Na, S,
K, Ti, and V (at 68\% and 95\% confidence, respectively). The strong
limits on C and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse
supernovae occurred during star formation in open clusters, which, thus,
need to form within {\lsim}6  $\{$Myr$\}$. Further development of this and
related techniques will bring the power of differential abundances to
stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic surveys and will
help unravel the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in
the Milky Way through chemical tagging.

	Abstract = {{Stars observed in the field of an open cluster are ideal for a
controlled test of chemical tagging. Using chemical tagging, one should
identify the cluster members, i.e., those stars of similar chemical
composition, if their composition is indeed different from that of all
the non-member stars of the field. Moreover, the abundance-based
membership can be checked against membership based on radial velocities
and proper motions. Here, I report preliminary results of such an
experiment using data from the Gaia-ESO Survey. Although the three
membership criteria usually agree, a few interesting examples of
discrepant membership classification have been found. In addition, the
mean composition of each open cluster was compared to a sample of 1 600
Gaia-ESO field stars. Some cases of field stars with abundances matching
those of the open clusters were identified. This experiment suggests
that open clusters do not necessarily have unique abundance patterns
that set them apart from all other clusters.

	Abstract = {{In the era of large-scale Galactic astronomy and multi-object
spectroscopic stellar surveys, the sample sizes and the number of
available stellar chemical abundances have reached dimensions in which
it has become difficult to process all the available information in an
effective manner. In this paper we demonstrate the use of a
dimensionality-reduction technique (t-distributed stochastic neighbour
embedding; t-SNE) for analysing the stellar abundance-space
distribution. While the non-parametric non-linear behaviour of this
technique makes it difficult to estimate the significance of any
abundance-space substructure found, we show that our results depend
little on parameter choices and are robust to abundance errors. By
reanalysing the high-resolution high-signal-to-noise solar-neighbourhood
HARPS-GTO sample with t-SNE, we find clearer chemical separations of the
high- and low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] disc sequences, hints for multiple
populations in the high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] population, and indications that
the chemical evolution of the high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] metal-rich stars is
connected with the super-metal-rich stars. We also identify a number of
chemically peculiar stars, among them a high-confidence
s-process-enhanced abundance-ratio pair (HD 91345/HD 126681) with very
similar ages and v $_{ X }$ and v $_{ Y }$ velocities, which
we suggest have a common birth origin, possibly a dwarf galaxy. Our
results demonstrate the potential of abundance-space t-SNE and similar
methods for chemical-tagging studies with large spectroscopic surveys.

	Abstract = {{This paper presents abundances for 12 red giants of the old open cluster
Collinder 261 based on spectra from the Very Large Telescope UVES.
Abundances were derived for Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zr, and Ba. We
find that the cluster has a solar-level metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.03 dex.
However, most {$\alpha$}- and s-process elements were found to be enhanced.
The star-to-star scatter was consistent with the expected measurement
uncertainty for all elements. The observed rms scatter is as follows:
Na=0.07, Mg=0.05, Si=0.06, Ca=0.05, Mn=0.03, Fe=0.02, Ni=0.04, Zr=0.12,
and Ba=0.03 dex. The intrinsic scatter was estimated to be less than
0.05 dex. Such high levels of homogeneity indicate that chemical
information remains preserved in this old open cluster. We use the
chemical homogeneity we have now established in Cr 261, the Hyades, and
the HR 1614 moving group to examine the uniqueness of the individual
cluster abundance patterns, i.e., chemical signatures. We demonstrate
that the three studied clusters have unique chemical signatures and
discuss how other such signatures may be searched for in the future. Our
findings support the prospect of chemically tagging disk stars to common
formation sites in order to unravel the dissipative history of the
Galactic disk.

halo with chemical abundance patterns that indicate they originally
formed in globular clusters. Using data from the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Survey available
through Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12, we first
identify likely halo giants, and then search those for the well-known
chemical tags associated with globular clusters, specifically enrichment
in nitrogen and aluminum. We find that 2\% of the halo giants in our
sample have this chemical signature, in agreement with previous results.
Following the interpretation in our previous work on this topic, this
would imply that at least 13\% of halo stars originally formed in
globular clusters. Recent developments in the theoretical understanding
of globular cluster formation raise questions about that interpretation,
and we concede the possibility that these migrants represent a small
fraction of the halo field. There are roughly as many stars with the
chemical tags of globular clusters in the halo field as there are in
globular clusters, whether or not they are accompanied by a much larger
chemically untaggable population of former globular cluster stars.

	Abstract = {{Formation of globular clusters (GCs), the Galactic bulge, or galaxy
bulges in general is an important unsolved problem in Galactic
astronomy. Homogeneous infrared observations of large samples of stars
belonging to GCs and the Galactic bulge field are one of the best ways
to study these problems. We report the discovery by APOGEE (Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment) of a population of field
stars in the inner Galaxy with abundances of N, C, and Al that are
typically found in GC stars. The newly discovered stars have high
[N/Fe], which is correlated with [Al/Fe] and anticorrelated with [C/Fe].
They are homogeneously distributed across, and kinematically
indistinguishable from, other field stars within the same volume. Their
metallicity distribution is seemingly unimodal, peaking at [Fe/H]
{\tilde} -1, thus being in disagreement with that of the Galactic GC
system. Our results can be understood in terms of different scenarios.
N-rich stars could be former members of dissolved GCs, in which case the
mass in destroyed GCs exceeds that of the surviving GC system by a
factor of {\tilde}8. In that scenario, the total mass contained in
so-called `first-generation' stars cannot be larger than that in
`second-generation' stars by more than a factor of {\tilde}9 and was
certainly smaller. Conversely, our results may imply the absence of a
mandatory genetic link between `second-generation' stars and GCs. Last,
but not least, N-rich stars could be the oldest stars in the Galaxy, the
by-products of chemical enrichment by the first stellar generations
formed in the heart of the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{Using 17 chemical elements as a proxy for stellar DNA, we present a full
phylogenetic study of stars in the solar neighbourhood. This entails
applying a clustering technique that is widely used in molecular biology
to construct an evolutionary tree from which three branches emerge.
These are interpreted as stellar populations that separate in age and
kinematics and can be thus attributed to the thin disc, the thick disc
and an intermediate population of probable distinct origin. We further
find six lone stars of intermediate age that could not be assigned to
any population with enough statistical significance. Combining the ages
of the stars with their position on the tree, we are able to quantify
the mean rate of chemical enrichment of each of the populations, and
thus show in a purely empirical way that the star formation rate in the
thick disc is much higher than that in the thin disc. We are also able
to estimate the relative contribution of dynamical processes such as
radial migration and disc heating to the distribution of chemical
elements in the solar neighbourhood. Our method offers an alternative
approach to chemical tagging methods with the advantage of visualizing
the behaviour of chemical elements in evolutionary trees. This offers a
new way to search for 'common ancestors' that can reveal the origin of
solar neighbourhood stars.

both chemically and kinematically using the fourth data release of the
RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE). We used a sample of 57 HiVel stars
with Galactic rest-frame velocities larger than 275 km s$^{-1}$.
With 6D position and velocity information, we integrated the orbits of
the HiVel stars and found that, on average, they reach out to 13 kpc
from the Galactic plane and have relatively eccentric orbits consistent
with the Galactic halo. Using the stellar parameters and [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
estimates from RAVE, we found the metallicity distribution of the HiVel
stars peak at [M/H] = -1.2 dex and is chemically consistent with the
inner halo. There are a few notable exceptions that include a
hypervelocity star candidate, an extremely HiVel bound halo star, and
one star that is kinematically consistent with the halo but chemically

metal-rich HiVel star candidate and the second highest velocity star in
the sample. Using these high-resolution data, we report the discovery of
a metal-rich halo star that has likely been dynamically ejected into the
halo from the Galactic thick disc. This discovery could aid in
explaining the assembly of the most metal-rich component of the Galactic
halo.

	Abstract = {{In preparation for the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element
Spectrograph (HERMES) chemical tagging survey of about a million
Galactic FGK stars, we estimate the number of independent dimensions of
the space defined by the stellar chemical element abundances [X/Fe].
This leads to a way to study the origin of elements from observed
chemical abundances using principal component analysis. We explore
abundances in several environments, including solar neighbourhood
thin/thick disc stars, halo metal-poor stars, globular clusters, open
clusters, the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal
galaxy. By studying solar-neighbourhood stars, we confirm the
universality of the r-process that tends to produce [neutron-capture
elements/Fe] in a constant ratio. We find that, especially at low
metallicity, the production of r-process elements is likely to be
associated with the production of {$\alpha$}-elements. This may support the
core-collapse supernovae as the r-process site. We also verify the
overabundances of light s-process elements at low metallicity, and find
that the relative contribution decreases at higher metallicity, which
suggests that this lighter elements primary process may be associated
with massive stars. We also verify the contribution from the s-process
in low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars at high metallicity. Our
analysis reveals two types of core-collapse supernovae: one produces
mainly {$\alpha$}-elements, the other produces both {$\alpha$}-elements and
Fe-peak elements with a large enhancement of heavy Fe-peak elements
which may be the contribution from hypernovae. Excluding light elements
that may be subject to internal mixing, K and Cu, we find that the
[X/Fe] chemical abundance space in the solar neighbourhood has about six
independent dimensions both at low metallicity (-3.5 {\lsim} [Fe/H]
{\lsim}-2) and high metallicity ([Fe/H] {\gsim}-1). However the dimensions
come from very different origins in these two cases. The extra
contribution from low-mass AGB stars at high metallicity compensates the
dimension loss due to the homogenization of the core-collapse supernovae
ejecta. Including the extra dimensions from [Fe/H], K, Cu and the light
elements, the number of independent dimensions of the [X/Fe]+[Fe/H]
chemical space in the solar neighbourhood for HERMES is about eight to
nine. Comparing fainter galaxies and the solar neighbourhood, we find
that the chemical space for fainter galaxies such as Fornax and the
Large Magellanic Cloud has a higher dimensionality. This is consistent
with the slower star formation history of fainter galaxies. We find that
open clusters have more chemical space dimensions than the nearby
metal-rich field stars. This suggests that a survey of stars in a larger
Galactic volume than the solar neighbourhood may show about one more
dimension in its chemical abundance space.

	Abstract = {{The aim of Galactic archaeology is to recover the history of our Galaxy
through the information encoded in stars. An unprobed assumption of this
field is that the chemical composition of a star is an immutable marker
of the gas from which it formed. It is vital to test this assumption on
open clusters, a group of stars formed from the same gas. Previous
investigations have shown that unevolved stars in clusters are
chemically homogeneous within the typical uncertainties of these
analyses, i.e., 15\% of the elemental abundances. Our strictly
differential analysis on five members of the Pleiades allows us to reach
precisions of 5\% for most elements and to unveil chemical anomalies
within the cluster that could be explained by planet engulfment events.
These results reveal that the evolution of planetary systems may alter
the chemical composition of stars, challenging our capability of tagging
them to their native environments, and also paving the way for the study
of planetary architectures and their evolution, through the chemical
pattern of their host stars.

	Abstract = {{Context. The chemical tagging technique is a promising approach to
reconstructing the history of the Galaxy by only using stellar chemical
abundances. Multiple studies have undertaken this analysis and they have
raised several challenges. <BR /> Aims: Using a sample of open cluster
stars, we wish to address two issues: minimize chemical abundance
differences whose origin is linked to the evolutionary stage of the
stars and not their original composition and evaluate a phylogenetic
approach to group stars based on their chemical composition. <BR />
Methods: We derived differential chemical abundances for 207 stars,
belonging to 34 open clusters, using the Sun as reference star
(classical approach) and a dwarf plus a giant star from the open cluster
M 67 as reference (new approach). These abundances were then used to
perform two phylogenetic analyses: cladistics (maximum parsimony) and
neighbor joining, together with a partitioning unsupervised
classification analysis with k-means. The resulting groupings were
finally confronted to the true open cluster memberships of the stars.
<BR /> Results: We successfully reconstruct most of the original open
clusters when carefully selecting a subset of the abundances derived
differentially with respect to M 67. We find a set of eight chemical
elements that yield the best result and discuss the possible reasons for
these elements to be good tracers of the history of the Galaxy. <BR />
Conclusions: Our study shows that unraveling the history of the Galaxy
by only using stellar chemical abundances is greatly improved provided
that i) we perform a differential spectroscopic analysis with respect to
an open cluster instead of the Sun, ii) select the chemical elements
that are good tracers of the history of the Galaxy, and iii) use tools
that are adapted to detect evolutionary tracks such as phylogenetic
approaches.

	Abstract = {{Context. Stars are born together from giant molecular clouds and, if we
assume that the priors were chemically homogeneous and well-mixed, we
expect them to share the same chemical composition. Most of the stellar
aggregates are disrupted while orbiting the Galaxy and most of the
dynamic information is lost, thus the only possibility of reconstructing
the stellar formation history is to analyze the chemical abundances that
we observe today. <BR /> Aims: The chemical tagging technique aims to
recover disrupted stellar clusters based merely on their chemical
composition. We evaluate the viability of this technique to recover
co-natal stars that are no longer gravitationally bound. <BR /> Methods:
Open clusters are co-natal aggregates that have managed to survive
together. We compiled stellar spectra from 31 old and intermediate-age
open clusters, homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters, and 17
abundance species, and applied machine learning algorithms to group the
stars based on their chemical composition. This approach allows us to
evaluate the viability and efficiency of the chemical tagging technique.
<BR /> Results: We found that stars at different evolutionary stages
have distinct chemical patterns that may be due to NLTE effects, atomic
diffusion, mixing, and biases. When separating stars into dwarfs and
giants, we observed that a few open clusters show distinct chemical
signatures while the majority show a high degree of overlap. This limits
the recovery of co-natal aggregates by applying the chemical tagging
technique. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement if more elements
are included and models are improved.

	Abstract = {{Deviations of the potentials of stellar systems from integrability cause
stars to diffuse through three-dimensional orbit space. The
Fokker-Planck equation that describes this diffusion takes a
particularly simple form when actions are used as orbit-space
coordinates. The rate of diffusion is governed by a vector {$\Delta$} and a
tensor {$\Delta$}$^{2}$, which according to the circumstances of a
particular problem should be calculated either from kinetic theory or
from Hamiltonian perturbation theory. In many astrophysically
interesting circumstances {$\Delta$} is related to the divergence of the
more readily calculated tensor {$\Delta$}$^{2}$. In addition to being
computationally handy, this relationship ensures that the orbital
diffusion described by the Fokker-Planck equation causes the system's
entropy, derived from any H-function, to increase whenever the system is
interacting with a hotter system of scatterers. An investigation of the
heating of stellar discs in the light of these general results is

	Abstract = {{The Fokker-Planck equation that describes the heating of a stellar disk
under the combined influence of stochastic spiral structure and giant
molecular clouds is solved by Monte Carlo simulation. The velocity
ellipsoid near the sun is expected to depend on the relative importance
of spiral structure and molecular clouds in the sense that
sigma(z)/sigma(R) decreases as clouds become less important. The
intensity of stochastic spiral structure near the sun is derived.
Velocity distributions in the r- and z-directions are predicted for both
a coeval stellar population and a population that grows at a constant
rate. The v(z)-distribution of a uniformly growing population is
expected to be remarkably Gaussian.

	Abstract = {{Dynamical mass discrepancies in galaxies have two possible explanations:
the existence of large amounts of dark matter or the breakdown of
Newtonian gravity. True dark matter halos of galaxies could differ in
several respects from apparent halos inferred from misinterpreted
modified gravity, and we discuss two observational tests to probe these
differences. Modified gravity gives generic, geometrical predictions for
the shapes of apparent halos, and also requires that the inferred excess
mass strongly correlates with the visible baryonic mass. Thus modified
gravity is more easily falsified, but we find both hypotheses to be
consistent with the meager data on galaxy and cluster halos; dark matter
is not required by current data. We strongly encourage the acquisition
of more data, which could ultimately eliminate one or other of these
possibilities.

	Abstract = {{We study the formation of stellar haloes in three Milky Way-mass
galaxies using cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations,
focusing on the subset of halo stars that form in situ, as opposed to
those accreted from satellites. In situ stars in our simulations
dominate the stellar halo out to 20 kpc and account for 30-40 per cent
of its total mass. We separate in situ halo stars into three
straightforward, physically distinct categories according to their
origin: stars scattered from the disc of the main galaxy (`heated
disc'), stars formed from gas smoothly accreted on to the halo (`smooth'
gas) and stars formed in streams of gas stripped from infalling
satellites (`stripped' gas). We find that most belong to the stripped
gas category. Those originating in smooth gas outside the disc tend to
form at the same time and place as the stripped-gas population,
suggesting that their formation is associated with the same gas-rich
accretion events. The scattered disc star contribution is negligible
overall but significant in the solar neighbourhood, where {\gsim}90 per
cent of stars on eccentric orbits once belonged to the disc. However,
the distinction between halo and thick disc in this region is highly
ambiguous. The chemical and kinematic properties of the different
components are very similar at the present day, but the global
properties of the in situ halo differ substantially between the three
galaxies in our study. In our simulations, the hierarchical buildup of
structure is the driving force behind not only the accreted stellar
halo, but also those halo stars formed in situ.

function of galactocentric distance, along different lines of sight
above and along the disk plane, and as a function of cosmic time. We
find that: (1) approximately 70\% of today's stars formed in-situ; (2)
more than two thirds of the ex-situ stars formed within satellites after
infall; (3) the majority of ex-situ stars are found today in the disk
and in the bulge; (4) the stellar halo is dominated by ex-situ stars,
whereas in-situ stars dominate the mass profile at distances $\lt$\~{} 5 kpc
from the center at high latitudes; and (5) approximately 25\% of the

@article{Tissera2013,
	Abstract = {{We investigate the chemical and kinematic properties of the diffuse
stellar haloes of six simulated Milky-Way-like galaxies from the
Aquarius Project. Binding energy criteria are adopted to define two
dynamically distinct stellar populations: the diffuse inner and outer
haloes, which comprise different stellar subpopulations with particular
chemical and kinematic characteristics. Our simulated inner- and
outer-halo stellar populations have received contributions from debris
stars (formed in subgalactic systems while they were outside the virial
radius of the main progenitor galaxies) and endo-debris stars (those
formed in gas-rich subgalactic systems inside the dark matter haloes of
the main progenitor galaxy). The inner haloes possess an additional
contribution from disc-heated stars, in the range {\tilde}3-30 per cent,
with a mean of {\tilde}20 per cent. Disc-heated stars might exhibit
signatures of kinematical support, in particular among the youngest
ones. Endo-debris plus disc-heated stars define the so-called in situ
stellar populations. In both the inner- and outer-halo stellar
populations, we detect contributions from stars with moderate to low
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios, mainly associated with the endo-debris or
disc-heated subpopulations. The observed abundance gradients in the
inner-halo regions are influenced by both the level of chemical
enrichment and the relative contributions from each stellar
subpopulation. Steeper abundance gradients in the inner-halo regions are
related to contributions from the disc-heated and endo-debris stars,
which tend to be found at lower binding energies than debris stars. In
the case of the outer-halo regions, although [Fe/H] gradients are
relatively mild, the steeper profiles arise primarily due to
contributions from stars formed in more massive satellites, which sink
farther into the main halo system, and tend to have higher levels of
chemical enrichment and lower energies. Our findings support the
existence of (at least) two distinct diffuse stellar halo populations,
as suggested by a number of recent observations in the Milky Way and
M31. Our results also indicate that a comparison of the range of
predicted kinematics, abundance gradients and frequency of
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]-deficient stars with observations of these quantities in
the Milky Way, M31 and other large spirals can both provide clues to
improve the modelling of baryonic physics, and reveal detailed
information about their likely history of formation and evolution.

	Abstract = {{We use the Galaxies-Intergalactic Medium Interaction Calculation (GIMIC)
suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the global
structure and kinematics of stellar spheroids of Milky Way mass disc
galaxies. Font et al. have recently demonstrated that these simulations
are able to successfully reproduce the satellite luminosity functions
and the metallicity and surface brightness profiles of the spheroids of
the Milky Way and M31. A key to the success of the simulations is a
significant contribution to the spheroid from stars that formed in situ.
While the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars, stars formed in the
main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r{\lsim} 30 kpc. In the present
study, we show that this component was primarily formed in a protodisc
at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by
dynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of
its origin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different
kinematics (namely net prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than
that of the spheroid component built from the disruption of satellites.
In addition, the in situ component has a flattened distribution, which
is due in part to its rotation. We make comparisons with measurements of
the shape and kinematics of local galaxies, including the Milky Way and
M31, and stacked observations of more distant galaxies. We find that the
simulated disc galaxies have spheroids of the correct shape (oblate with
a median axial ratio of {\tilde}0.6 at radii of {\lsim}30 kpc, but note
there is significant system-to-system scatter in this quantity) and that
the kinematics show evidence for two components (due to in situ versus
accreted), as observed. Our findings therefore add considerable weight
to the importance of dissipative processes in the formation of stellar
haloes and to the notion of a 'dual stellar halo'.

	Abstract = {{We use the Galaxies-Intergalactic Medium Interaction Calculation (GIMIC)
suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation
of stellar spheroids of Milky Way mass disc galaxies. The simulations
contain accurate treatments of metal-dependent radiative cooling, star
formation, supernova feedback and chemodynamics, and the large volumes
that have been simulated yield an unprecedentedly large sample of
{\ap}400 simulated {\tilde}L$_{*}$ disc galaxies. The simulated
galaxies are surrounded by low-mass, low surface brightness stellar
haloes that extend out to {\tilde}100 kpc and beyond. The diffuse stellar
distributions bear a remarkable resemblance to those observed around the
Milky Way, M31 and other nearby galaxies, in terms of mass density,
surface brightness and metallicity profiles. We show that in situ star
formation typically dominates the stellar spheroids by mass at radii of
r{\lsim} 30 kpc, whereas accretion of stars dominates at larger radii and
this change in origin induces a change in the slope of the surface
brightness and metallicity profiles, which is also present in the
observational data. The system-to-system scatter in the in situ mass
fractions of the spheroid, however, is large and spans over a factor of
4. Consequently, there is a large degree of scatter in the shape and
normalization of the spheroid density profile within r{\lsim} 30 kpc
(e.g. when fitted by a spherical power-law profile, the indices range
from -2.6 to -3.4). We show that the in situ mass fraction of the
spheroid is linked to the formation epoch of the system. Dynamically,
older systems have, on average, larger contributions from in situ star
formation, although there is significant system-to-system scatter in
this relationship. Thus, in situ star formation likely represents the
solution to the long-standing failure of pure accretion-based models to
reproduce the observed properties of the inner spheroid.

	Abstract = {{We report the probable detection of the stellar population in the outer
Galactic disk in the direction of the southern Galactic warp. VIc CCD
photometry was obtained for four fields toward the southern Galactic
warp and four control fields at equal longitudes but opposite latitudes.
All fields were chosen to have uniform star densities and galaxies
visible in or very near the fields. More stars are seen in all four warp
fields compared to the four control directions, and the excesses are
unlikely to be caused solely by the sun's position north of midplane.
One warp-control field pair appear to have very similar reddening versus
distance behavior, and simple subtraction of the control field from the
warp field reveals a well-defined main sequence and perhaps a turnoff
for the outer stellar disk. In the absence of detailed reddening and
metallicity estimates, we cannot yet estimate the distances and ages of
the outer disk stars.

	Abstract = {{We re-examine recent claims of observational evidence for a dual
Galactic halo in SEGUE/SDSS data, and trace them back to improper error
treatment and neglect of selection effects. In particular, the detection
of a vertical abundance gradient in the halo can be explained as a
metallicity bias in distance. A similar bias and the impact of disk
contamination affect the sample of blue horizontal branch stars. These
examples highlight why non-volume complete samples require forward
modeling from theoretical models or extensive bias-corrections. We also
show how observational uncertainties produce the specific
non-Gaussianity in the observed azimuthal velocity distribution of halo
stars, which can be erroneously identified as two Gaussian components. A
single kinematic component yields an excellent fit to the observed data,
when we model the measurement process including distance uncertainties.
Furthermore, we show that sample differences in proper motion space are
the direct consequence of kinematic cuts and are enhanced when distance
estimates are less accurate. Thus, their presence is neither proof of a
separate population nor a measure of reliability for the applied
distances. We conclude that currently there is no evidence from
SEGUE/SDSS that would favor a dual Galactic halo over a single halo that
is full of substructure.

@article{Beers2012,
	Abstract = {{Carollo et al. have recently resolved the stellar population of the
Milky Way halo into at least two distinct components, an inner halo and
an outer halo. This result has been criticized by Sch{\"o}nrich et al.,
who claim that the retrograde signature associated with the outer halo
is due to the adoption of faulty distances. We refute this claim, and
demonstrate that the Sch{\"o}nrich et al. photometric distances are
themselves flawed because they adopted an incorrect main-sequence
absolute magnitude relationship from the work of Ivezi{\'c} et al.
When compared to the recommended relation from Ivezi{\'c} et al.,
which is tied to a Milky Way globular cluster distance scale and
accounts for age and metallicity effects, the relation adopted by
Sch{\"o}nrich et al. yields up to 18\% shorter distances for stars near
the main-sequence turnoff (TO). Use of the correct relationship yields
agreement between the distances assigned by Carollo et al. and
Ivezi{\'c} et al. for low-metallicity dwarfs to within 6\%-10\%.
Sch{\"o}nrich et al. also point out that intermediate-gravity stars
(3.5 $\lt$=log g $\lt$ 4.0) with colors redder than the TO region are
likely misclassified, with which we concur. We implement a new procedure
to reassign luminosity classifications for the TO stars that require it.
New derivations of the rotational behavior demonstrate that the
retrograde signature and high velocity dispersion of the outer-halo
population remain. We summarize additional lines of evidence for a dual
halo, including a test of the retrograde signature based on proper
motions alone, and conclude that the preponderance of evidence strongly
rejects the single-halo interpretation.

	Abstract = {{The halo of the Milky Way provides unique elemental abundance and
kinematic information on the first objects to form in the Universe, and
this information can be used to tightly constrain models of galaxy
formation and evolution. Although the halo was once considered a single
component, evidence for its dichotomy has slowly emerged in recent years
from inspection of small samples of halo objects. Here we show that the
halo is indeed clearly divisible into two broadly overlapping structural
components-an inner and an outer halo-that exhibit different spatial
density profiles, stellar orbits and stellar metallicities (abundances
of elements heavier than helium). The inner halo has a modest net
prograde rotation, whereas the outer halo exhibits a net retrograde
rotation and a peak metallicity one-third that of the inner halo. These
properties indicate that the individual halo components probably formed
in fundamentally different ways, through successive dissipational
(inner) and dissipationless (outer) mergers and tidal disruption of
proto-Galactic clumps.

@article{Abadi2006,
	Abstract = {{We use numerical simulations to investigate the origin and structure of
the luminous haloes that surround isolated galaxies. These stellar
structures extend out to several hundred kpc away from a galaxy, and
consist of stars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion
events that characterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies. Such an
origin suggests that outer luminous haloes are ubiquitous and that they
should appear as an excess of light over extrapolations of the galaxy's
inner profile beyond its traditional luminous radius. The mass profile
of the accreted stellar component is well approximated by a model where
the logarithmic slope steepens monotonically with radius; from
{$\rho$}\~{}r$^{-3}$ at the luminous edge of the galaxy to
r$^{-4}$ or steeper near the virial radius of the system. Such
spatial distribution is consistent with that of Galactic and M31
globular clusters, suggesting that many of the globulars were brought in
by accretion events, in a manner akin to the classic Searle-Zinn
scenario. Luminous haloes are similar in shape to their dark matter
counterparts, which are only mildly triaxial and much rounder than dark
haloes formed in simulations that do not include a dissipative luminous
component. The outer stellar spheroid is supported by a velocity
dispersion tensor with a substantial and radially increasing radial
anisotropy: from
{$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{r}$/{$\sigma$}$^{2}$$_{t}$\~{} 2 at
the edge of the central galaxy to \~{}5 at the virial radius. These
properties distinguish the stellar halo from the dark matter component,
which is more isotropic in velocity space, as well as from some tracers
of the outer spheroid such as satellite galaxies. Most stars in the
outer halo formed in progenitors that have since merged with the central
galaxy or have been substantially disrupted in its immediate
surroundings; very few stars in the halo are contributed by satellites
that survive as self-bound entities at the present. Although the stellar
spheroid in the simulations is more prominent than in disc-dominated
galaxies, many of these features are in reasonable agreement with recent
observations of the outer halo of the Milky Way, of M31, and of other
isolated spirals, and suggest that all of these systems underwent an
early period of active merging, as envisioned in hierarchical models of
galaxy formation.

	Abstract = {{A new estimate of the local density of halo giants - 36 +/- 7 with M(V)
less than 0.5 per cu kpc - is presented. This number is derived from an
objective-prism survey for nearby metal-weak stars, and so is free from
many of the assumptions needed to derive the local halo density in the
traditional way, from high proper motion surveys. This number agrees
well with estimates of the local density of halo horizontal-branch
stars, but is approximately a factor of 2 smaller than the density
derived by Bahcall and Casertano (1986). This may be due to the
inclusion of some thick disk stars in their proper-motion selected
sample. The halo density derived from giants can be expressed as a
disk-to-halo ratio of 850:1 (+/- 35 percent). Using these results, a
simple model is built to predict numbers of halo giants in specified
directions in the Galaxy. It is shown that it performs much better than
the Bahcall-Soniera model, in the specific case of halo giants. The
surface brightness due to the halo at the solar radius is calculated to
be 27.7 V magnitudes per sq arcsec, if the Galaxy was viewed from the
outside, edge-on, thus raising the possibility of detecting light from
halo field stars in other galaxies similar to our own.

the isochrones of VandenBerg (1985) and of Bergbusch {\amp} VandenBerg
(1992) in the {$\delta$}M\_V\_, log T\_eff\_ plane. The interstellar color
excesses, E(b-y), and photometric metallicities, [Fe/H], of the stars
have been determined using our previous photometric calibrations.
Membership of the stars in the different stellar populations has been
determined using the V\_rot\_,[Fe/H] diagram, and Galactic orbits
calculated for the halo stars employing the Galactic mass distribution
of Allen {\amp} Santillan (1991). Combining with previous work and
cleansing the samples of the more obvious binary-star contamination,
ages remain for 71 halo stars and for 296 ``high-velocity disk'' stars of
which 24 are from the nearly pure thick-disk sample of Paper VI. Our
previous conclusions are mostly confirmed that there is good evidence
for a cosmic age scatter of several Gyr within the halo field stars and
that there is considerable overlap between the ages of the halo stars
and the older disk stars. However, the previously found metallicity-age
correlation for the halo field stars has mostly disappeared. In
addition, evidence is found that the inner part of the halo is older and
has a smaller age dispersion than the outer part, and that, on the
average, the thick disk is only 1-2 Gyr younger than the halo having a
mean age similar to that of the outer halo. These results are discussed
and interpreted in terms of various formation scenarios for the thick
disk, dual-halo models, and ``inside-out'' evolutionary schemes for the
Galaxy proposed in the literature.

	Abstract = {{We present simulations of the formation of thick discs via the accretion
of two-component satellites onto a pre-existing thin disc. Our goal is
to establish the detailed characteristics of the thick discs obtained in
this way, as well as their dependence on the initial orbital and
internal properties of the accreted objects. We find that mergers with
10-20 per cent mass of the host lead to the formation of thick discs
whose characteristics are similar, both in morphology as in kinematics,
to those observed. Despite the relatively large mass ratios, the host
discs are not fully destroyed by the infalling satellites: a remaining
kinematically cold and thin component containing \~{}15-25 per cent of the
mass can be identified, which is embedded in a hotter and thicker disc.
This may for example, explain the existence of a very old thin disc
stars in the Milky Way. The final scaleheights of the discs depend both
on the initial inclination and properties of the merger, but the
fraction of satellite stellar particles at \~{}4 scaleheights directly
measures the mass ratio between the satellite and host galaxy. Our thick
discs typically show boxy isophotes at very low surface brightness
levels ($\gt$6mag below their peak value). Kinematically, the velocity
ellipsoids of the simulated thick discs are similar to that of the
Galactic thick disc at the solar radius. The trend of with radius is
found to be a very good discriminant of the initial inclination of the
accreted satellite. In the Milky Way, the possible existence of a
vertical gradient in the rotational velocity of the thick disc as well
as the observed value of at the solar vicinity appear to favour the
formation of the thick disc by a merger with either low or intermediate
orbital inclination.

satellite companions, with special attention given to: the
self-consistent response of disks to satellite mergers, which
generalizes an earlier investigation by Quinn {\amp} Goodman (1986); the
evolution of satellite orbits and debris; and the long-term structure
and kinematics of thickened disks as compared with observed properties
of disk galaxies. For satellites with masses in the range 0.04-0.2
M$_{disk}$ on initially circular inclined prograde orbits merging
with disks similar to the thin disk of the Galaxy, it is found that the
dynamical coupling between disks and satellites leads to orbital decay.
Disks respond to mergers by spreading both radially and vertically. The
radial heating is driven largely by the spiral response of the
dynamically cool disks to satellite perturbations.

	Abstract = {{Recent spectroscopic observations in the Milky Way suggest that the
chemically defined thick disk (stars that have high [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios
and are thus old) has a significantly smaller scale-length than the thin
disk. This is in apparent contradiction with observations of external
edge-on galaxies, where the thin and thick components have comparable
scale-lengths. Moreover, while observed disks do not flare (scale-height
does not increase with radius), numerical simulations suggest that disk
flaring is unavoidable, resulting from both environmental effects and
secular evolution. Here we address these problems by studying two
different suites of simulated galactic disks formed in the cosmological
context. We show that the scale-heights of coeval populations always
increase with radius. However, the total population can be decomposed
morphologically into thin and thick disks, which do not flare. We relate
this to the disk inside-out formation, where younger populations have
increasingly larger scale-lengths and flare at progressively larger
radii. In this new picture, thick disks are composed of the imbedded
flares of mono-age stellar populations. Assuming that disks form inside
out, we predict that morphologically defined thick disks must show a
decrease in age (or [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios) with radius and that coeval
populations should always flare. This also explains the observed
inversion in the metallicity and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] gradients for stars away
from the disk midplane in the Milky Way. The results of this work are
directly linked to, and can be seen as evidence of, inside-out disk
growth.

	Abstract = {{We compare the spatial, kinematic, and metallicity distributions of
stars in the Milky Way disk, as observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
and Geneva-Copenhagen Survey, to predictions made by N-body simulations
that naturally include radial migration as proposed by Sellwood {\amp}
Binney. In these simulations, stars that migrate radially outward feel a
decreased restoring force, consequentially they reach larger heights
above the mid-plane. We find that this model is in qualitative agreement
with observational data and can explain the disk's double-exponential
vertical structure and other characteristics as due to internal
evolution. In particular, the model reproduces observations of stars in
the transition region between exponential components, which do not show
a strong correlation between rotational velocity and metallicity.
Although such a correlation is present in young stars because of
epicyclic motions, radial migration efficiently mixes older stars and
weakens the correlation. Classifying stars as members of the thin or
thick disk by either velocity or metallicity leads to an apparent
separation in the other property, as observed. We find a much stronger
separation when using [{$\alpha$}/Fe], which is a good proxy for stellar
age. The model success is remarkable because the simulation was not
tuned to reproduce the Galaxy, hinting that the thick disk may be a
ubiquitous Galactic feature generated by stellar migration. Nonetheless,
we cannot exclude the possibility that some fraction of the thick disk
is a fossil of a more violent history, nor can radial migration explain
thick disks in all galaxies, most strikingly those which counterrotate
with respect to the thin disk.

	Abstract = {{The formation of thick stellar disks in spiral galaxies is studied.
Simulations of gas-rich young galaxies show formation of internal clumps
by gravitational instabilities, clump coalescence into a bulge, and disk
thickening by strong stellar scattering. The bulge and thick disks of
modern galaxies may form this way. Simulations of minor mergers make
thick disks too, but there is an important difference. Thick disks made
by internal processes have a constant scale height with galactocentric
radius, but thick disks made by mergers flare. The difference arises
because in the first case, perpendicular forcing and disk-gravity
resistance are both proportional to the disk column density, so the
resulting scale height is independent of this density. In the case of
mergers, perpendicular forcing is independent of the column density and
the low-density regions get thicker; the resulting flaring is
inconsistent with observations. Late-stage gas accretion and thin-disk
growth are shown to preserve the constant scale heights of thick disks
formed by internal evolution. These results reinforce the idea that disk
galaxies accrete most of their mass smoothly and acquire their structure
by internal processes, in particular through turbulent and clumpy phases
at high redshift.

	Abstract = {{We present a detailed analysis of the disk component of a simulated
galaxy formed in the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmogony. At redshift z=0, two
distinct dynamical components are easily identified solely on the basis
of the orbital parameters of stars in the galaxy: a slowly rotating,
centrally concentrated spheroid and a disklike component largely
supported by rotation. The disk may be further decomposed into a thin,
dynamically cold component with stars on nearly circular orbits and a
hotter, thicker component with orbital parameters transitional between
the thin disk and the spheroid. Supporting evidence for the presence of
distinct thick- and thin-disk components is provided, as in the Milky
Way, by the double-exponential vertical structure of the disk and in
abrupt changes in the vertical velocity distribution as a function of
stellar age. The dynamical origin of these components offers intriguing
clues to the assembly of spheroids and disks in the Milky Way and other
spiral galaxies. The spheroid is old and has essentially no stars
younger than the time elapsed since the last major accretion event, \~{}8
Gyr ago for the system we consider here. The majority of thin-disk
stars, on the other hand, form after the merging activity is over,
although a significant fraction (\~{}15\%) of thin-disk stars are old enough
to predate the last major merger event. This unexpected population of
old-disk stars consists mainly of the tidal debris of satellites whose
orbital plane was coincident with the disk and whose orbits were
circularized by dynamical friction prior to full disruption. More than
half of the stars in the thick disk share this origin, part of a trend
that becomes more pronounced with age: 9 out of 10 stars presently in
the old (age of $\gt$\~{}10 Gyr) disk component were actually brought into
the disk by satellites. By contrast, only one in two stars belonging to
the old spheroid are tidal debris; the rest may be traced to a major
merger event that dispersed the luminous progenitor at z\~{}1.5 and seeded
the formation of the spheroid. Our results highlight the role of
satellite accretion events in shaping the disk, as well as the
spheroidal, component and reveal some of the clues to the assembly
process of a galaxy preserved in the detailed dynamics of old stellar
populations.

	Abstract = {{We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galaxy that assumes
two main infall episodes, for the formation of the halo-thick disk and
thin disk, respectively. We do not try to take into account explicitly
the evolution of the halo since our model is better suited for computing
the evolution of the disk (thick plus thin), but we implicitly assume
that the timescale for the formation of the halo was of the same order
as the timescale for the formation of the thick disk. The formation of
the thin disk is much longer than that of the thick disk, implying that
the infalling gas forming the thin disk comes not only from the thick
disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium.

The timescale for the formation of the thin disk is assumed to be a
function of Galactocentric distance, leading to an inside-out picture
for the Galaxy's building. The model takes into account the most
up-to-date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts a threshold in the
star formation process, which naturally produces a hiatus in the star
formation rate at the end of the thick-disk phase, as suggested by
recent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set
of observational constraints both for the solar neighborhood and for the
whole disk. Among these constraints, the tightest is the metallicity
distribution of the G-dwarf stars, for which new data are now available.
Our model fits these new data very well.

The model also predicts the evolution of the gas mass, the star
formation rate, the supernova rates, and the abundances of 16 chemical
elements as functions of time and Galactocentric distance. We show that,
in order to reproduce most of these constraints, a timescale of $\lt$=1
Gyr for the (halo) thick disk and of 8 Gyr for the thin disk's formation
in the solar vicinity are required.

We predict that the radial abundance gradients in the inner regions of
the disk (R $\lt$ 1 R$_{&sun;}$) are steeper than in the outer
regions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that
the inner gradients steepen during the Galactic lifetime. The importance
and the advantages of assuming a threshold gas density for the onset of
the star formation process are discussed.

	Abstract = {{This article summarizes recent work on the luminosity and mass
distribution of the galactic bulge and disk, and on the mass of the
Milky Way's dark halo. A new luminosity model consistent with the COBE
NIR data and the apparent magnitude distributions of bulge clump giant
stars has bulge/bar length of \~{}=3.5 kpc, axis ratios of 1:(0.3-0.4):0.3,
and short disk scale-length (\~{}=2.1 kpc). Gas-dynamical flows in the
potential of this model with constant M/L fit the terminal velocities in
10{\deg} le|l|le50{\deg} very well. The luminous mass distribution with
this M/L is consistent with the surface density of known matter near the
Sun, but still underpredicts the microlensing optical depth towards the
bulge. Together, these facts argue strongly for a massive, near-maximal
disk in our \~{}L\^{}*, Sbc spiral galaxy. While the outer rotation curve and
global mass distribution are not as readily measured as in similar
spiral galaxies, the dark halo mass estimated from satellite velocities
is consistent with a flat rotation curve continuing on from the luminous
mass distribution.

new moderate-resolution spectroscopic data obtained with multiobject
spectrographs on the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory 4 m telescopes are used to determine radial
velocities and mean cluster metallicities. These new results are
combined with data published previously by Friel {\amp} Janes to provide
a sample of 459 giants in 39 old open clusters, which are used to
investigate radial abundance gradients in the Galactic disk. Based on an
updated abundance calibration of spectroscopic indices measuring Fe and
Fe-peak element blends, this larger sample yields an abundance gradient
of -0.06+/-0.01 dex kpc$^{-1}$ over a range in Galactocentric
radius of 7 to 16 kpc. There is a slight suggestion of a steepening of
the abundance gradient with increasing cluster age in this sample, but
the significance of the result is limited by the restricted distance
range for the youngest clusters. The clusters show no correlation of
metallicity with age in the solar neighborhood. Consistent with the
evidence for a steepening of the gradient with age, the clusters in the
outer disk beyond 10 kpc show a suggestion at the 1.5 {$\sigma$} level of a
dependence of metallicity on age.

clusters, and in these clustered environments, newborn stars can have
profound effects on one another and on their parent gas clouds. Feedback
from clustered stars is almost certainly responsible for a number of
otherwise puzzling facts about star formation:  (1) it is an inefficient
process that proceeds slowly when averaged over galactic scales; (2)
most stars disperse from their birth sites and dissolve into the
galactic field over timescales {\#61501}1 gigayears (G.y.); and (3)
newborn stars follow an initial mass function (IMF) with a distinct peak
in the range 0.1-1 M{\sun}, rather than an IMF dominated by brown dwarfs.
In this review, we summarize current observational constraints and
theoretical models for the complex interplay between clustered star

	Abstract = {{Star formation is slow in the sense that the gas consumption time is
much longer than the dynamical time. It is also inefficient; star
formation in local galaxies takes place in giant molecular clouds
(GMCs), but the fraction of a GMC converted to stars is very small,
epsilon$_{GMC}$ \~{} 5\%. In luminous starbursts, the GMC lifetime is
shorter than the main-sequence lifetime of even the most massive stars,
so that supernovae can play no role in GMC disruption. We investigate
the disruption of GMCs across a wide range of galaxies from normal
spirals to the densest starbursts; we take into account the effects of H
II gas pressure, shocked stellar winds, protostellar jets, and radiation
pressure produced by the absorption and scattering of starlight on dust
grains. In the Milky Way, a combination of three mechanisms{\mdash}jets,
H II gas pressure, and radiation pressure{\mdash}disrupts the clouds. In
more rapidly star-forming galaxies such as ``clump'' galaxies at
high-redshift, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), and
submillimeter galaxies, radiation pressure dominates natal cloud
disruption. We predict the presence of \~{}10-20 clusters with masses
\~{}10$^{7}$ M $_{sun}$ in local ULIRGs such as Arp 220 and a
similar number of clusters with M $_{*}$ \~{} 10$^{8}$ M
$_{sun}$ in high redshift clump galaxies; submillimeter galaxies
will have even more massive clusters. We find that epsilon$_{GMC}$
= {$\pi$}G{$\Sigma$}$_{GMC}$ c/(2(L/M $_{*}$)) for GMCs that are
optically thin to far-infrared radiation, where {$\Sigma$}$_{GMC}$ is
the GMC gas surface density. The efficiency in optically thick systems
continues to increase with {$\Sigma$}$_{GMC}$, but more slowly,
reaching \~{}35\% in the most luminous starbursts. The disruption of bubbles
by radiation pressure stirs the interstellar medium (ISM) to velocities
of \~{}10 km s$^{-1}$ in normal galaxies and to \~{}100 km
s$^{-1}$ in ULIRGs like Arp 220, consistent with observations.
Thus, radiation pressure may play a dominant dynamical role in the ISM
of star-forming galaxies.

	Abstract = {{Chemical tagging of stars based on their similar compositions can offer
new insights about the star formation and dynamical history of the Milky
Way. We investigate the feasibility of identifying groups of stars in
chemical space by forgoing the use of model derived abundances in favour
of direct analysis of spectra. This facilitates the propagation of
measurement uncertainties and does not pre-suppose knowledge of which
elements are important for distinguishing stars in chemical space. We
use {\tilde}16 000 red giant and red clump H-band spectra from the Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and perform
polynomial fits to remove trends not due to abundance-ratio variations.
Using expectation maximized principal component analysis, we find
principal components with high signal in the wavelength regions most
important for distinguishing between stars. Different subsamples of red
giant and red clump stars are all consistent with needing about 10
principal components to accurately model the spectra above the level of
the measurement uncertainties. The dimensionality of stellar chemical
space that can be investigated in the H band is therefore {\lsim}10. For
APOGEE observations with typical signal-to-noise ratios of 100, the
number of chemical space cells within which stars cannot be
distinguished is approximately 10$^{10$\pm$2}$ {\times} (5
{\plusmn} 2)$^{n - 10}$ with n the number of principal components.
This high dimensionality and the fine-grained sampling of chemical space
are a promising first step towards chemical tagging based on spectra
alone.

	Abstract = {{The first generation of large-scale chemical tagging surveys, in
particular the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph
(HERMES)/Galactic Archaeology with HERMES million star survey, promises
to vastly expand our understanding of the chemical and dynamical
evolution of the Galaxy. This, however, is contingent on our ability to
confidently perform chemical tagging on such a large data set. Chemical
homogeneity has been observed across a range of elements within several
Galactic open clusters, yet the level to which this is the case
globally, and particularly in comparison to the scatter across clusters
themselves, is not well understood. The patterns of elements in coeval
cluster members, occupying a complex chemical abundance space, are
rooted in the evolution, ultimately the nature of the very late stages,
of early generations of stars. The current astrophysical models of such
stages are not yet sufficient to explain all observations, combining
with our significant gaps in the understanding of star formation, makes
this a difficult arena to tackle theoretically. Here, we describe a
robust pair-wise metric used to gauge the chemical difference between
two stellar components. This metric is then applied to a data base of
high-resolution literature abundance sources to derive a function
describing the probability that two stars are of common evolutionary
origin. With this cluster probability function, it will be possible to
report a confidence, grounded in empirical observational evidence, with
which clusters are detected, independent of the group finding methods.
This formulation is also used to probe the role of chemical
dimensionality, and that of individual chemical species, on the ability
of chemical tagging to differentiate coeval groups of stars.

chemical signature of planet formation detected among the sample stars,
I.e. no correlations in abundances versus condensation temperature; (2)
the observed abundance dispersions are a factor of {\ap}1.5-2 larger than
the average measurement errors for most elements; (3) there are positive
correlations, of high statistical significance, between the abundances
of at least 90 per cent of pairs of elements. We demonstrate that none

inhomogeneous at the 0.02 dex level. Possible explanations for the
abundance variations include (1) inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the

	Abstract = {{We present a theoretical framework in which bound stellar clusters arise
naturally at the high-density end of the hierarchy of the interstellar
medium (ISM). Due to short free-fall times, these high-density regions
achieve high local star formation efficiencies, enabling them to form
bound clusters. Star-forming regions of lower density remain
substructured and gas-rich, ending up unbound when the residual gas is
expelled. Additionally, the tidal perturbation of star-forming regions
by nearby, dense giant molecular clouds imposes a minimum density
contrast required for the collapse to a bound cluster. The fraction of
all star formation that occurs in bound stellar clusters (the cluster
formation efficiency, hereafter CFE) follows by integration of these
local clustering and survival properties over the full density spectrum
of the ISM, and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive the CFE
as a function of observable galaxy properties, and find that it
increases with the gas surface density, from {$\Gamma$} {\tilde} 1 per cent
in low-density galaxies to a peak value of {$\Gamma$} {\tilde} 70 per cent
at densities of {$\Sigma$}$_{g}$ {\tilde} 10$^{3}$
M$_{&sun;}$ pc$^{-2}$. This explains the observation that
the CFE increases with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf,
spiral and starburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our model results with
observed galaxies yields excellent agreement. The model is applied
further by calculating the spatial variation of the CFE within single
galaxies. We also consider the variation of the CFE with cosmic time and
show that it increases with redshift, peaking in high-redshift, gas-rich
disc galaxies. It is estimated that up to 30-35 per cent of all stars in
the Universe once formed in bound stellar clusters. We discuss how our
theory can be verified with Gaia and ALMA, and provide possible
implementations for theoretical work and for simulations of galaxy
formation and evolution.

	Abstract = {{Clusters that form in total 10$^{3}$$\lt$\~{} N$\lt$\~{} 10$^{5}$
stars (type II clusters) lose their gas within a dynamical time as a
result of the photoionizing flux from O stars. Sparser (type I) clusters
get rid of their residual gas on a time-scale longer or comparable to
the nominal crossing time and thus evolve approximately adiabatically.
This is also true for massive embedded clusters (type III) for which the
velocity dispersion is larger than the sound speed of the ionized gas.
On expelling their residual gas, type I and III clusters are therefore
expected to lose a smaller fraction of their stellar component than type
II clusters. We outline the effect this has on the transformation of the
mass function of embedded clusters (ECMF), which is directly related to
the mass function of star cluster-forming molecular cloud cores, to the
`initial' MF of bound gas-free star clusters (ICMF). The resulting ICMF
has, for a featureless power-law ECMF, a turnover near 10$^{4.5}$
M$_{solar}$ and a peak near 10$^{3}$ M$_{solar}$. The
peak lies close to the initial masses of the Hyades, Praesepe and
Pleiades clusters. We also find that the entire Galactic population II

embedded clusters distributed like a power-law MF with exponent 0.9

	Abstract = {{We investigate how the removal of interstellar material by stellar
feedback limits the efficiency of star formation in molecular clouds and
how this determines the shape of the mass function of young star
clusters. In particular, we derive relations between the power-law
exponents of the mass functions of the clouds and clusters in the
limiting regimes in which the feedback is energy driven and momentum
driven, corresponding to minimum and maximum radiative losses, and
likely to bracket all realistic cases. We find good agreement between
the predicted and observed exponents, especially for momentum-driven
feedback, provided the protoclusters have roughly constant mean surface
density, as indicated by observations of the star-forming clumps within
molecular clouds. We also consider a variety of specific feedback
mechanisms, concluding that H II regions inflated by radiation pressure
predominate in massive protoclusters, a momentum-limited process when
photons can escape after only a few interactions with dust grains. We
show in this case that the star formation efficiency depends on the
masses and sizes of the protoclusters only through their mean surface
density, thus ensuring consistency between the observed exponents of the
mass functions of the clouds and clusters. Our numerical estimate of
this efficiency is also consistent with observations.

	Abstract = {{We have carried out a large set of N-body simulations studying the
effect of residual-gas expulsion on the survival rate, and final
properties of star clusters. We have varied the star formation
efficiency (SFE), gas expulsion time-scale and strength of the external
tidal field, obtaining a three-dimensional grid of models which can be
used to predict the evolution of individual star clusters or whole star
cluster systems by interpolating between our runs. The complete data of
these simulations are made available on the internet.

Our simulations show that cluster sizes, bound mass fraction and
velocity profile are strongly influenced by the details of the gas
expulsion. Although star clusters can survive SFEs as low as 10 per cent
if the tidal field is weak and the gas is removed only slowly, our
simulations indicate that most star clusters are destroyed or suffer
dramatic loss of stars during the gas removal phase. Surviving clusters
have typically expanded by a factor of 3 or 4 due to gas removal,
implying that star clusters formed more concentrated than as we see them
today. Maximum expansion factors seen in our runs are around 10. If gas
is removed on time-scales smaller than the initial crossing time, star
clusters acquire strongly radially anisotropic velocity dispersions
outside their half-mass radii. Observed velocity profiles of star
clusters can therefore be used as a constraint on the physics of cluster
formation.

@article{Feng2014,
	Abstract = {{The abundances of elements in stars are critical clues to stars'
origins. Observed star-to-star variations in logarithmic abundance
within an open star cluster--a gravitationally bound ensemble of stars
in the Galactic plane--are typically only about 0.01 to 0.05 over many
elements, which is noticeably smaller than the variation of about 0.06
to 0.3 seen in the interstellar medium from which the stars form. It is
unknown why star clusters are so homogenous, and whether homogeneity
should also prevail in regions of lower star formation efficiency that
do not produce bound clusters. Here we report simulations that trace the
mixing of chemical elements as star-forming clouds assemble and
collapse. We show that turbulent mixing during cloud assembly naturally
produces a stellar abundance scatter at least five times smaller than
that in the gas, which is sufficient to explain the observed chemical
homogeneity of stars. Moreover, mixing occurs very early, so that
regions with star formation efficiencies of about 10 per cent are nearly
as well mixed as those with formation efficiencies of about 50 per cent.
This implies that even regions that do not form bound clusters are
likely to be well mixed, and improves the prospects of using `chemical
tagging' to reconstruct (via their unique chemical signatures, or tags)
star clusters whose constituent stars have become unbound from one
another and spread across the Galactic disk.

	Abstract = {{Context. VISTA Variables in the V{\'{\i}}a L{\'a}ctea (VVV) is one of
the six ESO Public Surveys operating on the new 4-m Visible and Infrared
Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA). VVV is scanning the Milky Way
bulge and an adjacent section of the disk, where star formation activity
is high. One of the principal goals of the VVV Survey is to find new
star clusters of differentages. <BR /> Aims: In order to trace the early
epochs of star cluster formation we concentrated our search in the
directions to those of known star formation regions, masers, radio, and
infrared sources. <BR /> Methods: The disk area covered by VVV was
visually inspected using the pipeline processed and calibrated
K$_{S}$-band tile images for stellar overdensities. Subsequently,
we examined the composite JHK$_{S}$ and ZJK$_{S}$ color
images of each candidate. PSF photometry of 15 {\times} 15 arcmin fields
centered on the candidates was then performed on the Cambridge Astronomy
Survey Unit reduced images. After statistical field-star
decontamination, color-magnitude and color-color diagrams were
constructed and analyzed. <BR /> Results: We report the discovery of 96
new infrared open clusters and stellar groups. Most of the new cluster
candidates are faint and compact (with small angular sizes), highly
reddened, and younger than 5 Myr. For relatively well populated cluster
candidates we derived their fundamental parameters such as reddening,
distance, and age by fitting the solar-metallicity Padova isochrones to
the color-magnitude diagrams.

	Abstract = {{Aims: According to some estimations, there are as many as 100 000 open
clusters in the Galaxy, but less than 2000 of them have been discovered,
measured, and cataloged. We plan to undertake data mining of
multiwavelength surveys to find new star clusters.  <BR />Methods: We
have developed a new method to search automatically for star clusters in
very large stellar catalogs, which is based on convolution with density
functions. We have applied this method to a subset of the Two Micron All
Sky Survey catalog toward the Galactic anticenter. We also developed a
method to verify whether detected stellar groups are real star clusters,
which tests whether the stars that form the spatial density peak also
fall onto a single isochrone in the color-magnitude diagram. By fitting
an isochrone to the data, we estimate at the same time the main physical
parameters of a cluster: age, distance, color excess.   <BR />Results:
For the present paper, we carried out a detailed analysis of 88
overdensity peaks detected in a field of 16{\times}16 degrees near the
Galactic anticenter. From this analysis, 15 overdensities were confirmed
to be new open clusters and the physical and structural parameters were
determined for 12 of them; 10 of them were previously suspected to be
open clusters by Kronberger (2006) and Froebrich (2007). The properties
were also determined for 13 yet-unstudied known open clusters, thus
almost tripling the sample of open clusters with studied parameters in
the anticenter. The parameters determined with this method showed a good
agreement with published data for a set of well-known clusters.

	Abstract = {{We carried out a survey of infrared star clusters and stellar groups on
the 2MASS J, H and K$_{s}$ all-sky release Atlas in the Northern
and Equatorial Milky Way (350$^{deg}$ $\lt$ l $\lt$ 360
$^{deg}$, 0$^{deg}$ $\lt$ l $\lt$ 230 $^{deg}$). The
search in this zone complements that in the Southern Milky Way (Dutra et
al. $\backslash$cite$\{$Dutra03$\}$a). The method concentrates efforts on the directions
of known optical and radio nebulae. The present study provides 167 new
infrared clusters, stellar groups and candidates. Combining the two
studies for the whole Milky Way, 346 infrared clusters, stellar groups
and candidates were discovered, whereas 315 objects were previously
known. They constitute an important new sample for future detailed
studies.

	Abstract = {{Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at
infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15
years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first
systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In
this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge
concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of
the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic
embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and
estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We
find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open
clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant
mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded
clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound
clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in
embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with
masses in excess of 50 M$_{&sun;}$. Moreover, observations of
nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a
significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the
role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial
mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over
the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to
substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the
role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk
evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding
the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas
concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and
the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.

	Abstract = {{We present abundances for a sample of F, G, and K dwarfs of the HR 1614
moving group based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio
spectra from the Anglo-Australian Telescope UCLES instrument. Our sample
includes stars from Feltzing and Holmberg, as well as from Eggen.
Abundances were derived for Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zr, Ba, Ce,
Nd, and Eu. The {$\alpha$}, Fe, and Fe-peak element abundances show a
bimodal distribution, with four stars having solar metallicities, while
the remaining 14 stars are metal-rich, [Fe/H]$\gt$=0.25 dex. However, the
abundances of these two groups converge for the heavier n-capture
elements. Based on their photometry and kinematics, three of the four
deviating stars are likely nonmembers or binaries. Although one star
cannot be excluded on these grounds, we do expect low-level
contamination from field stars within the HR 1614 moving group's range
of magnitude, color, and space velocities. Disregarding these four
stars, the abundance scatter across the group members for all elements
is low. We find that there is an 80\% probability that the intrinsic
scatter does not exceed the following values: Fe, 0.01 dex; Na, 0.08
dex; Mg, 0.02 dex; Al, 0.06 dex; Si, 0.02 dex; Ca, 0.02 dex; Mn, 0.01
dex; Ni, 0.01 dex; Zr, 0.03 dex; Ba, 0.03 dex; Ce, 0.04 dex; Nd, 0.01
dex; and Eu, 0.02 dex. The homogeneity of the HR 1614 group in age and
abundance suggests that it is the remnant of a dispersed star-forming
event. Its kinematical coherence shows that such a dispersing system
need not be significantly perturbed by external dynamical influences
such as Galactic spiral structure or giant molecular clouds, at least
over a period of 2 Gyr.

stellar spectroscopic surveys, such as Galactic Archaeology with HERMES
(GALAH) and the Gaia European Southern Observatory survey (Gaia-ESO),
will represent major milestones in the quest to chemically tag the
Galaxy. Yet this technique to reconstruct dispersed coeval stellar
groups has remained largely untested until recently. We build on
previous work that developed an empirical chemical tagging probability
function, which describes the likelihood that two field stars are
conatal, that is, they were formed in the same cluster environment. In
this work, we perform the first ever blind chemical tagging experiment,
i.e. tagging stars with no known or otherwise discernible associations,
on a sample of 714 disc field stars with a number of high-quality
high-resolution homogeneous metal abundance measurements. We present
evidence that chemical tagging of field stars does identify coeval
groups of stars, yet these groups may not represent distinct formation
sites, e.g. as in dissolved open clusters, as previously thought. Our
results point to several important conclusions, among them that group
finding will be limited strictly to chemical abundance space, e.g.
stellar ages, kinematics, colours, temperature and surface gravity do
not enhance the detectability of groups. We also demonstrate that in
addition to its role in probing the chemical enrichment and kinematic
history of the Galactic disc, chemical tagging represents a powerful new
stellar age determination technique.

the halo-cluster system inferred from the abundance results are
examined. It is found that the distribution over abundance of the halo
globular clusters is independent of galactocentric distance for
distances exceeding 8 kpc and that the clusters exhibit differences in
the morphology of their color-magnitude diagrams that are uncorrelated
with metal abundance. The characteristics of the system of halo clusters
are compared with implications of some simple conceptual schemes for the
formation of the Galaxy. It is suggested that the halo clusters

	Abstract = {{We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a ``gas'' of
self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when
sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We
propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales,
the mass spectrum of condensations becomes ``self-similar'' and
independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the
self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated
with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad
hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial
perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points
randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger
scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely.
The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these
appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can ``bootstrap''
their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our
self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of
galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We
compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather
striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then
isothermal ``seed'' masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at
recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds
are the galaxies themselves. The size of clusters determines, in
principle, the deceleration parameter q0 presently available data give
only very broad limits, unfortunately. Subject headings: cosmology -

	Abstract = {{The (U, V, W)-velocity vectors for 221 well-observed dwarf stars have
been used to compute the eccentricities and angular momenta of the
galactic orbits in a model galaxy. It is shown that the eccentricity and
the observed ultraviolet excess are strongly correlated. The stars with
the largest excess (i.e., lowest metal abundance) are invariably moving
in highly elliptical orbits, whereas stars with little or no excess move
in nearly circular orbits. Correlations also exist between the
ultraviolet excess and the W-velocity. Finally, the excess and the
angnlar momentum are correlated; stars with large ultraviolet excesses
have small angular momenta. These correlations are discussed in terms of
the dynamics of a collapsing galaxy. The data require that the oldest
stars were formed out of gas falling toward the galactic center in the
radial direction and collapsing from the halo onto the plane. The
collapse was very rapid and only a few times 108 years were required for
the gas to attain circular orbits in equilibrium (i e., gravitational
attraction balanced by centrifugal acceleration). The scale of the
collapse is tentatively estimated to be at least 10 in the radial
direction and 25 in the Z-direction. The initial contraction must have
begun near the time of formation of the first stars, some 1010 years
ago.

	Abstract = {{Chemical tagging promises to use detailed abundance measurements to
identify spatially separated stars that were, in fact, born together (in
the same molecular cloud) long ago. This idea has not yielded much
practical success, presumably because of the noise and incompleteness in
chemical-abundance measurements. We have succeeded in substantially
improving spectroscopic measurements with The Cannon, which has now
delivered 15 individual abundances for {\tilde} $\{$10$\}$$^{5}$ stars
observed as part of the APOGEE spectroscopic survey, with precisions
around 0.04 dex. We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking at
clusters in abundance space and confirming that they are clustered in
phase space. We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of
stars in the 15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by The
Cannon, and plot the associated stars in phase space. We use only
abundance-space information (no positional information) to identify
stellar groups. We find that clusters in abundance space are indeed
clusters in phase space, and we recover some known phase-space clusters
and find other interesting structures. This is the first-ever project to
identify phase-space structures at the survey-scale by blind search
purely in abundance space; it verifies the precision of the abundance
measurements delivered by The Cannon the prospects for future data sets

	Abstract = {{The clustered nature of star formation should produce a high degree of
structure in the combined phase and chemical space in the Galactic disk.
To date, observed structure of this kind has been mostly limited to
bound clusters and moving groups. In this paper we present a new
dynamical model of the Galactic disk that takes into account the
clustered nature of star formation. This model predicts that the
combined phase and chemical space is rich in substructure, and that this
structure is sensitive to both the precise nature of clustered star
formation and the large-scale properties of the Galaxy. The model
self-consistently evolves 4 billion stars over the last 5 Gyr in a
realistic potential that includes an axisymmetric component, a bar,
spiral arms, and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). All stars are born in
clusters with an observationally-motivated range of initial conditions.
As direct $\backslash$textit$\{$N$\}$-body calculations for billions of stars is
computationally infeasible, we have developed a method of initializing
star cluster particles to mimic the effects of direct $\backslash$textit$\{$N$\}$-body
effects, while the actual orbit integrations are treated as test
particles within the analytic potential. We demonstrate that the
combination of chemical and phase space information is much more
effective at identifying truly co-natal populations than either chemical
or phase space alone. Furthermore, we show that co-moving pairs of stars
are very likely to be co-natal if their velocity separation is $\lt 2$
km s$^{-1}$ and their metallicity separation is $\lt 0.05$ dex. The
results presented here bode well for harnessing the synergies between
$\backslash$textit$\{$Gaia$\}$ and spectroscopic surveys to reveal the assembly history
of the Galactic disk.

covering the abundance range from disk to halo in a field chosen to

transition, the sample has been enlarged with similar samples of stars

of 'thick disk' has been introduced. For selected giants, abundances,
distances, and reddenings are derived, and velocity dispersion is
estimated. From the data presented, it is concluded that the disk and
halo abundance distributions overlap and that their kinematics are
discontinuous. The kinematics of the metal-weak red giants, with
abundances extended as low as Fe/H = -1.6, is compared with the
kinematics of the halo objects, and the data are interpreted with

galaxy formation.

	Abstract = {{Our Galaxy is a complex machine in which several processes operate
simultaneously: metal-poor gas is accreted, is chemically enriched by
dying stars, and then drifts inwards, surrendering its angular momentum
to stars; new stars are formed on nearly circular orbits in the
equatorial plane and then diffuse through orbit space to eccentric and
inclined orbits; the central stellar bar surrenders angular momentum to
the surrounding disc and dark halo while acquiring angular momentum from
inspiralling gas; the outer parts of the disc are constantly disturbed
by satellite objects, both luminous and dark, as they sweep through
pericentre. We review the conceptual tools required to bring these
complex happenings into focus. Our first concern must be the
construction of equilibrium models of the Galaxy, for upon these hang
our hopes of determining the Galaxy's mean gravitational field, which is
required for every subsequent step. Ideally our equilibrium model should
be formulated so that the secular evolution of the system can be
modelled with perturbation theory. Such theory can be used to understand
how stars diffuse through orbit space from either the thin gas disc in
which we presume disc stars formed, or the debris of an accreted object,
the presumed origin of many halo stars. Coupling this understanding to
the still very uncertain predictions of the theory of stellar evolution
and nucleosynthesis, we can finally extract a complete model of the
chemodynamic evolution of our reasonably generic Galaxy. We discuss the
relation of such a model to cosmological simulations of galaxy
formation, which provide general guidance but cannot be relied on for
quantitative detail.

	Abstract = {{We investigate the formation and evolution of the pseudobulge in ``Eris,''
a high-resolution N-body + smoothed particle hydrodynamic cosmological
simulation that successfully reproduces a Milky-Way-like massive
late-type spiral in an cold dark matter universe. At the present epoch,
Eris has a virial mass M $_{vir}$ \~{}= 8 {\times} 10$^{11}$ M
$_{&sun;}$, a photometric stellar mass M $_{*}$ = 3.2
{\times} 10$^{10}$ M $_{&sun;}$, a bulge-to-total ratio B/T
= 0.26, and a weak nuclear bar. We find that the bulk of the pseudobulge
forms quickly at high redshift via a combination of non-axisymmetric
disk instabilities and tidal interactions or mergers, both occurring on
dynamical timescales, not through slow secular processes at lower
redshift. Its subsequent evolution is not strictly secular either, and
is closely intertwined with the evolution of the stellar bar. In fact,
the structure that we recognize as a pseudobulge today evolved from a
stellar bar that formed at high redshift due to tidal interactions with
satellites, was destroyed by minor mergers at z \~{} 3, re-formed shortly
after, and weakened again following a steady gas inflow at z $\lt$\~{} 1.
The gradual dissolution of the bar ensued at z \~{} 1 and continues until
the present without increasing the stellar velocity dispersion in the
inner regions. In this scenario, the pseudobulge is not a separate
component from the inner disk in terms of formation path; rather, it is
the first step in the inside-out formation of the baryonic disk, in
agreement with the fact that pseudobulges of massive spiral galaxies
typically have a dominant old stellar population. If our simulations do
indeed reproduce the formation mechanisms of massive spirals, then the
progenitors of late-type galaxies should have strong bars and small
photometric pseudobulges at high redshift.

corotation radius for an individual spiral wave, but since transient
waves with a wide range of pattern speeds develop in rapid succession,
the entire disc is affected. This behaviour has profound consequences
for the metallicity gradients with radius in both stars and gas, since
the interstellar medium is also stirred by the same mechanism. We find

	Abstract = {{Different stellar sub-populations of the Milky Way's stellar disk are
known to have different vertical scale heights, their thickness
increasing with age. Using SEGUE spectroscopic survey data, we have
recently shown that mono-abundance sub-populations, defined in the
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]-[Fe/H] space, are well described by single-exponential
spatial-density profiles in both the radial and the vertical direction;
therefore, any star of a given abundance is clearly associated with a
sub-population of scale height h$_{z}$ . Here, we work out how to
determine the stellar surface-mass density contributions at the solar
radius R $_{0}$ of each such sub-population, accounting for the
survey selection function, and for the fraction of the stellar
population mass that is reflected in the spectroscopic target stars
given populations of different abundances and their presumed age
distributions. Taken together, this enables us to derive $\backslash$Sigma
\_$\{$R\_0$\}$(h\_z), the surface-mass contributions of stellar populations with
scale height h$_{z}$ . Surprisingly, we find no hint of a
thin-thick disk bi-modality in this mass-weighted scale-height
distribution, but a smoothly decreasing function, approximately $\backslash$Sigma
\_$\{$R\_0$\}$(h\_z)$\backslash$propto $\backslash$exp (-h\_z), from h$_{z}$ {\ap} 200 pc to
h$_{z}$ {\ap} 1 kpc. As h$_{z}$ is ultimately the
structurally defining property of a thin or thick disk, this shows
clearly that the Milky Way has a continuous and monotonic distribution
of disk thicknesses: there is no ``thick disk'' sensibly characterized as
a distinct component. We discuss how our result is consistent with
evidence for seeming bi-modality in purely geometric disk decompositions
or chemical abundances analyses. We constrain the total visible stellar
surface-mass density at the solar radius to be $\backslash$Sigma \^{}$\{$\^{}*$\}$\_$\{$R\_0$\}$ = 30
+/- 1$\backslash$ M\_$\backslash$odot pc$^{-2}$.

	Abstract = {{We derive Bayesian distances for all stars in the RV sample of Gaia DR2,
and use the statistical method of Schoenrich, Binney {\amp} Asplund(2012)
to validate the distances and test the Gaia parallaxes. In contrast to
other methods, which rely on special sources, our method directly tests
the distances to all stars in our sample. We find clear evidence for a
near-linear trend of distance bias f with distance s, proving a parallax
offset delta p. On average, we find delta p = 0.054 mas (parallaxes in
Gaia DR2 need to be increased) when accounting for the parallax
uncertainty under-estimate in the Gaia set (delta p = 0.048 mas on the
raw parallax errors) with negligible formal error and a systematic
uncertainty of about 0.006 mas. The value is in concordance with results
from asteroseismic measurements, but differs from the much lower bias
found on quasar samples. We further use our method to compile a
comprehensive set of quality cuts in colour, apparent magnitude, and
astrometric parameters. Last, we find that for this sample delta p
appears to strongly depend on the parallax uncertainty sigma\_p (when
including the additional 0.043 mas) with a statistical confidence far in
excess of 10$\backslash$sigma and a proportionality factor close to 1, though the
dependence varies somewhat with sigma\_p. Correcting for the sigma\_p
dependence also resolves otherwise unexplained correlations of the
offset with the number of observation periods n\_$\{$vis$\}$ and ecliptic
latitude.

	Abstract = {{[ABRIDGED] The purpose of this work is to evaluate how several elements
produced by different nucleosynthesis processes behave with stellar age
and provide empirical relations to derive stellar ages from chemical
abundances. We derive different sets of ages using Gaia parallaxes for a
sample of more than 1000 FGK dwarf stars for which he have spectra from
the HARPS-GTO program. We analyze the temporal evolution of different
abundance ratios to find the best chemical clocks. We find that
[$\alpha$/Fe] ratio (average of Mg, Si and Ti), [O/Fe] and [Zn/Fe] are
good age proxies with a lower dispersion than the age-metallicity
dispersion. Several abundance ratios present a significant correlation
with age for chemically separated thin disk stars (i.e. low-$\alpha$)
but in the case of the chemically defined thick disk stars (i.e.
high-$\alpha$) only the elements Mg, Si, Ca and TiII show a clear
correlation with age. We find that the thick disk stars are more
enriched in light-s elements than thin disk stars of similar age. The
maximum enrichment of s-process elements in the thin disk occurs in the
youngest stars which in turn have solar metallicity. The slopes of the
[X/Fe]-age relations are quite constant for O, Mg, Si, Ti, Zn, Sr and Eu
regardless of the metallicity. However, this is not the case for Al, Ca,
Cu and most of the s-process elements, which display very different
trends depending on the metallicity. This demonstrates the limitations
of using simple linear relations based on certain abundance ratios to
obtain ages for stars of different metallicities. Finally, we show that
by using 3D relations with a chemical clock and two stellar parameters
(either Teff, [Fe/H] or stellar mass) we can explain up to 89\% of age
variance in a star. A similar result is obtained when using 2D relations
with a chemical clock and one stellar parameter, being up to a 87\% of
the variance explained.

	Abstract = {{Investigating the chemical homogeneity of stars born from the same
molecular cloud at virtually the same time is very important for our
understanding of the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium and
with it the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. One major cause of
inhomogeneities in the abundances of open clusters is stellar evolution
of the cluster members. In this work, we investigate variations in the
surface chemical composition of member stars of the old open cluster M67
as a possible consequence of atomic diffusion effects taking place
during the main-sequence phase. The abundances used are obtained from
high-resolution UVES/FLAMES spectra within the framework of the Gaia-ESO
Survey. We find that the surface abundances of stars on the main
sequence decrease with increasing mass reaching a minimum at the
turn-off. After deepening of the convective envelope in subgiant branch
stars, the initial surface abundances are restored. We found the
measured abundances to be consistent with the predictions of stellar
evolutionary models for a cluster with the age and metallicity of M67.
Our findings indicate that atomic diffusion poses a non-negligible
constraint on the achievable precision of chemical tagging methods.

for eight high-probability stellar members of the solar metallicity old
open cluster M67 with an age of {\tilde}4 Gyr. The eight stars consist of
four pairs, with each pair occupying a distinct phase of stellar
evolution: two G dwarfs, two turnoff stars, two G subgiants, and two red
clump (RC) K giants. The abundance analysis uses near-IR high-resolution
spectra ({$\lambda$}1.5-1.7 {$\mu$}m) from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment survey and derives abundances for C, N, O,
Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe. Our derived stellar
parameters and metallicity for 2M08510076+1153115 suggest that this star
is a solar twin, exhibiting abundance differences relative to the Sun of
{\le}0.04 dex for all elements. Chemical homogeneity is found within each
class of stars ({\tilde}0.02 dex), while significant abundance variations
({\tilde}0.05-0.20 dex) are found across the different evolutionary
phases; the turnoff stars typically have the lowest abundances, while
the RCs tend to have the largest. Non-LTE corrections to the LTE-derived
abundances are unlikely to explain the differences. A detailed
comparison of the derived Fe, Mg, Si, and Ca abundances with recently
published surface abundances from stellar models that include chemical
diffusion provides a good match between the observed and predicted
abundances as a function of stellar mass. Such agreement would indicate
the detection of chemical diffusion processes in the stellar members of

	Abstract = {{From exploratory studies and theoretical expectations it is known that
simplifying approximations in spectroscopic analysis (local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), 1D) lead to systematic biases of
stellar parameters and abundances. These biases depend strongly on
surface gravity, temperature and, in particular, for LTE versus non-LTE
(NLTE), on metallicity of the stars. Here we analyze the [Mg/Fe] and
[Fe/H] plane of a sample of 326 stars, comparing LTE and NLTE results
obtained using 1D hydrostatic models and averaged $\lt$3D$\gt$ 
models. We show that compared to the $\lt$3D$\gt$ NLTE benchmark,
the other three methods display increasing biases toward lower
metallicities, resulting in false trends of [Mg/Fe] against [Fe/H],
which have profound implications for interpretations by chemical
evolution models. In our best $\lt$3D$\gt$ NLTE model, the halo and
disk stars show a clearer behavior in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane,
from the knee in abundance space down to the lowest metallicities. Our
sample has a large fraction of thick disk stars and this population
extends down to at least [Fe/H] {\tilde} -1.6 dex, further than
previously proven. The thick disk stars display a constant [Mg/Fe] {\ap}
0.3 dex, with a small intrinsic dispersion in [Mg/Fe] that suggests that
a fast SN Ia channel is not relevant for the disk formation. The halo
stars reach higher [Mg/Fe] ratios and display a net trend of [Mg/Fe] at
low metallicities, paired with a large dispersion in [Mg/Fe]. These
indicate the diverse origin of halo stars from accreted low-mass systems
to stochastic/inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the Galactic halo.

	Abstract = {{Having shown in a recent paper that the main sequence of {$\omega$}
Centauri is split into two distinct branches, we now present
spectroscopic results showing that the bluer sequence is less
metal-poor. We have carefully combined VLT's GIRAFFE spectra of 17 stars
on each side of the split into a single spectrum for each branch, with
adequate signal-to-noise ratio, to show clearly that the stars of the
blue main sequence are less metal-poor by 0.3 dex than those of the
dominant red one. From an analysis of the individual spectra, we could
not detect any abundance spread among the blue main-sequence stars,
whereas the red main-sequence stars show a 0.2 dex spread in
metallicity. We use stellar structure models to show that only greatly
enhanced helium can explain the color difference between the two main
sequences, and we discuss ways in which this enhancement could have
arisen.

	Abstract = {{The ESA Gaia mission provides a unique time-domain survey for more than
1.6 billion sources with G \~{} 21 mag. We showcase stellar variability
across the Galactic colour-absolute magnitude diagram (CaMD), focusing
on pulsating, eruptive, and cataclysmic variables, as well as on stars
exhibiting variability due to rotation and eclipses. We illustrate the
locations of variable star classes, variable object fractions, and
typical variability amplitudes throughout the CaMD and illustrate how
variability-related changes in colour and brightness induce `motions'
using 22 months worth of calibrated photometric, spectro-photometric,
and astrometric Gaia data of stars with significant parallax. To ensure
a large variety of variable star classes to populate the CaMD, we
crossmatch Gaia sources with known variable stars. We also used the
statistics and variability detection modules of the Gaia variability
pipeline. Corrections for interstellar extinction are not implemented in
this article. Gaia enables the first investigation of Galactic variable
star populations across the CaMD on a similar, if not larger, scale than
previously done in the Magellanic Clouds. Despite observed colours not
being reddening corrected, we clearly see distinct regions where
variable stars occur and determine variable star fractions to within
Gaia's current detection thresholds. Finally, we show the most complete
description of variability-induced motion within the CaMD to date. Gaia
enables novel insights into variability phenomena for an unprecedented
number of stars, which will benefit the understanding of stellar
astrophysics. The CaMD of Galactic variable stars provides crucial
information on physical origins of variability in a way previously
accessible only for Galactic star clusters or external galaxies.

	Abstract = {{We study the ages of {$\alpha$}-rich and {$\alpha$}-poor stars in the halo
using a sample of F and G dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). To separate stars based on [{$\alpha$}/Fe], we have developed a new
semi-empirical spectral index-based method and applied it to the
low-resolution, moderate signal-to-noise SDSS spectra. The method can be
used to estimate the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] directly providing a new and widely
applicable way to estimate [{$\alpha$}/Fe] from low-resolution spectra. We
measured the main-sequence turnoff temperature and combined it with the
metallicities and a set of isochrones to estimate the age of the
{$\alpha$}-rich and {$\alpha$}-poor populations in our sample. We found all
stars appear to be older than 8 Gyr confirming the idea that the
Galactic halo was formed very early on. A bifurcation appears in the
age-metallicity relation such that in the low-metallicity regime the
{$\alpha$}-rich and {$\alpha$}-poor populations are coeval while in the
high-metallicity regime the {$\alpha$}-rich population is older than the
{$\alpha$}-poor population. Our results indicate the {$\alpha$}-rich halo
population, which has shallow age-metallicity relation, was formed in a
rapid event with high star formation, while the {$\alpha$}-poor stars were
formed in an environment with a slower chemical evolution time-scale.

@article{McWilliam2013,
	Abstract = {{From chemical abundance analysis of stars in the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy (Sgr), we conclude that the {$\alpha$}-element
deficiencies cannot be due to the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) time-delay
scenario of Tinsley. Instead, the evidence points to low [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
ratios resulting from an initial mass function (IMF) deficient in the
highest mass stars. The critical evidence is the 0.4 dex deficiency of
[O/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and other hydrostatic elements, contrasting with the
normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]$_{ r }$ with [Fe/H]. Supporting
evidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe]
ratios, which are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW)
disk trends. Also, the ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti)
element abundances suggests a relatively top-light IMF. Abundance
similarities with the LMC, Fornax, and IC 1613 suggest that their
{$\alpha$}-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs lacking the most
massive SNe II. The top-light IMF, as well as the normal trend of
r-process [Eu/Fe]$_{ r }$ with [Fe/H] in Sgr, indicates that
massive SNe II (gsim30 M $_{&sun;}$) are not major sources of
r-process elements. High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box
chemical evolution, are confirmed but \~{}0.3 dex larger than theoretical
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) predictions. This suggests that a
substantial increase in the theoretical $^{13}$C pocket in
low-mass AGB stars is required. Sgr has the lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known,
consistent with pollution by low-mass (lsim2 M $_{&sun;}$) AGB
stars near [Fe/H] = -0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical
evolution. The [Cu/O] trends in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields
increase with both metallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu
production by the weak s-process in massive stars. Finally, we present
an updated hyperfine splitting line list, an abundance analysis of
Arcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism.

history of a small nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Local Group. We
present the results of a high-resolution (R \~{} 20 000, {$\lambda$} =
5340-5620; 6120-6701) FLAMES/GIRAFFE abundance study at ESO/VLT of 81
photometrically selected, red giant branch stars in the central 25' of
the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We also carried out a detailed
comparison of the effects of recent developments in abundance analysis
(e.g., spherical models vs. plane-parallel) and the automation that is
required to efficiently deal with such large data sets. We present
abundances of {$\alpha$}-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), iron-peak elements
(Fe, Ni, and Cr), and heavy elements (Y, Ba, La, Nd, and Eu). Our sample
was randomly selected and is clearly dominated by the younger and more
metal-rich component of Fornax, which represents the major fraction of
stars in the central region. This means that the majority of our stars
are 1-4 Gyr old, and thus represent the end phase of chemical evolution
in this system. Our sample of stars has unusually low [ {$\alpha$}/Fe] ,
[Ni/Fe], and [Na/Fe] compared to the Milky Way stellar populations at
the same [Fe/H]. The particularly important role of stellar winds from
low-metallicity AGB stars in the creation of s-process elements is
clearly seen from the high [Ba/Y]. Furthermore, we present evidence of
an s-process origin of Eu.

	Abstract = {{We present measurements of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti abundances for 388
radial velocity member stars in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy
(dSph), a satellite of the Milky Way (MW). This is the largest sample of
individual {$\alpha$} element (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) abundance measurements
in any single dSph. The measurements are made from Keck/Deep Imaging
Multi-Object Spectrometer medium-resolution spectra (6400-9000 {\AA},
R \~{} 6500). Based on comparisons to published high-resolution (R gsim
20,000) spectroscopic measurements, our measurements have uncertainties
of {$\sigma$}[Fe/H] = 0.14 and {$\sigma$}[{$\alpha$}/Fe] = 0.13. The Sculptor
[Fe/H] distribution has a mean lang[Fe/H]rang = -1.58 and is asymmetric
with a long, metal-poor tail, indicative of a history of extended star
formation. Sculptor has a larger fraction of stars with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -2
than the MW halo. We have discovered one star with [Fe/H] = -3.80
{\plusmn} 0.28, which is the most metal-poor star known anywhere except
the MW halo, but high-resolution spectroscopy is needed to measure this
star's detailed abundances. As has been previously reported based on
high-resolution spectroscopy, [{$\alpha$}/Fe] in Sculptor falls as [Fe/H]
increases. The metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] \~{} -1.5) have lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
than Galactic halo field stars of comparable metallicity. This indicates
that star formation proceeded more gradually in Sculptor than in the
Galactic halo. We also observe radial abundance gradients of -0.030
{\plusmn} 0.003 dex arcmin$^{-1}$ in [Fe/H] and +0.013 {\plusmn}
0.003 dex arcmin$^{-1}$ in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] out to 11 arcmin (275 pc).
Together, these measurements cast Sculptor and possibly other surviving
dSphs as representative of the dwarf galaxies from which the metal-poor
tail of the Galactic halo formed.

	Abstract = {{We have used the Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on Kueyen (UT2)
of the Very Large Telescope to take spectra of 15 individual red giants
in the Sculptor, Fornax, Carina, and Leo I dwarf spheroidal galaxies
(dSph's). We measure the abundances of {$\alpha$}-, iron peak, first
s-process, second s-process, and r-process elements. No dSph giants in
our sample show the deep mixing abundance pattern (O and sometimes Mg
depleted, while Na and Al are enhanced) seen in nearly all globular
clusters. At a given metallicity the dSph giants exhibit lower [el/Fe]
abundance ratios for the {$\alpha$}-elements than stars in the Galactic
halo. The low {$\alpha$} abundances at low metallicities can be caused by a
slow star formation rate and contribution from Type Ia SNe, and/or a
small star formation event (low total mass) and mass-dependent Type II
SN yields. In addition, Leo I and Sculptor exhibit a declining even-Z
[el/Fe] pattern with increasing metallicity, while Fornax exhibits no
significant slope. In contrast, Carina shows a large spread in the
even-Z abundance pattern, even over small metallicity ranges, as might
be expected from a bursting star formation history. The metal-poor stars
in these dSph galaxies ([Fe/H]$\lt$-1) have halo-like s- and r-process
abundances, but not every dSph exhibits the same evolution in the s- and
r-process abundance pattern. Carina, Sculptor, and Fornax show a rise in
the s-/r-process ratio with increasing metallicity, evolving from a pure
r-process ratio to a solar-like s- and r-process ratio. On the other
hand, Leo I, appears to show an r-process-dominated ratio over the range
in metallicities sampled. At present, we attribute these differences in
the star formation histories of these galaxies. Comparison of the dSph
abundances with those of the halo reveals some consistencies with the
Galactic halo. In particular, Nissen {\amp} Shuster found that their
metal-rich, high R$_{max}$ high z$_{max}$ halo stars
exhibited low [{$\alpha$}/Fe], [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] abundance ratios. In the
same abundance range our dSph exhibit the same abundance pattern,
supporting their suggestions that disrupted dSph's may explain up to 50\%
of the metal-rich halo. Unfortunately, similar comparisons with the
metal-poor Galactic halo have not revealed similar consistencies,
suggesting that the majority of the metal-poor Galactic halo could not
have been formed from objects similar to the dSph studied here. We use
the dSph abundances to place new constraints on the nucleosynthetic
origins of several elements. We attribute differences in the evolution
of [Y/Fe] in the dSph stars versus the halo stars to a very weak AGB or
SN Ia yield of Y (especially compared with Ba). That a lower and flatter
Ba/Y ratio is seen in the halo is most likely a result of the pattern
being erased by the large metallicity dispersion in the halo. Also, we
find [Cu/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] are flat and halo-like over the metallicity
city range -2$\lt$[Fe/H]$\lt$-1.2, and that the [Cu/{$\alpha$}] ratios are
flat. Combining these abundances with knowledge of the age spread in
these galaxies suggests that SNe Ia are not the main site for the
production of Cu (and Mn) in very metal-poor stars. We suggest that
metallicity-dependent SN yields may be more promising.

	Abstract = {{The Keck I telescope and the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer
(HIRES) have been used to obtain spectra for red giant stars belonging
to the Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies.
An analysis of these spectra is presented, along with abundance ratios
for more than 20 elements. The resulting database of element abundances
for 17 dSph stars is the most extensive yet assembled for stars in such
environments. Our principal findings are summarized as follows. (1)
There is unambiguous evidence for a large internal dispersion in
metallicity in all three galaxies: our program stars span a range of
{$\Delta$}[Fe/H]=1.53, 1.40, and 0.73 dex in Draco, Sextans, and Ursa
Minor, respectively. (2) The abundance patterns among the dSph stars are
remarkably uniform, suggesting that three galaxies have similar
nucleosynthetic histories and, presumably, similar initial mass
functions. (3) A comparison of the measured element abundance ratios for
our sample of dSph stars with published values for Galactic halo and
disk field stars suggests that the dSph galaxies have
0.02$\lt$\~{}[{$\alpha$}/Fe]$\lt$\~{}0.13 dex, whereas the halo field star sample
has [{$\alpha$}/Fe]\~{}0.28 dex over the same range in metallicity. (4) The
most metal-rich dSph stars in our sample have [Y/Fe] abundances that are
significantly lower than those measured for halo field stars of similar
metallicity, while the measured [Ba/Eu] ratios for the dSph stars
suggest that the early chemical evolution of these galaxies was
dominated by the r-process. Taken together, these results suggest that
the Galactic halo is unlikely to have assembled, in its entirety,
through the disruption of dwarf galaxies similar to the low-luminosity,
$\lt$L$_{V}$$\gt$=3{\times}10$^{5}$L$_{V,solar}$, dSph
galaxies studied here. We also note that the measured [Zn/Fe] abundance
ratios for the dSph stars are lower than those of damped Ly{$\alpha$}
systems having low levels of dust depletion by roughly an order of
magnitude. The first high-resolution abundance analysis for the distant
Galactic globular cluster NGC 2419 is also presented. From a HIRES
spectrum of a single red giant, we find a metallicity of
[Fe/H]=-2.32+/-0.11 dex. This is slightly lower than, but still
consistent with, published estimates based on low-resolution
spectroscopy. With the possible exception of a slight enhancement in the
abundances of some heavy elements such as Ce, Nd, Y, and Ba, the
observed abundance pattern closely resembles those exhibited by red
giants in M92: a nearby, well-studied globular cluster of nearly
identical metallicity.

	Abstract = {{Recent work indicates that the nearby Galactic halo is dominated by the
debris from a major accretion event. We confirm that result from an
analysis of APOGEE-DR14 element abundances and Gaia-DR2 kinematics of
halo stars. We show that {\tilde}2/3 of nearby halo stars have high
orbital eccentricities (e {\gsim} 0.8), and abundance patterns typical of
massive Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites today, characterized by
relatively low [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe]. The trend followed
by high-e stars in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane shows a change of slope at
[Fe/H] {\tilde} -1.3, which is also typical of stellar populations from
relatively massive dwarf galaxies. Low-e stars exhibit no such change of
slope within the observed [Fe/H] range and show slightly higher
abundances of Mg, Al, and Ni. Unlike their low-e counterparts, high-e
stars show slightly retrograde motion, make higher vertical excursions,
and reach larger apocentre radii. By comparing the position in
[Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] space of high-e stars with those of accreted galaxies
from the EAGLE suite of cosmological simulations, we constrain the mass
of the accreted satellite to be in the range 10$^{8.5}$ {\lsim}
M$_{*}$ {\lsim} 10$^{9}$ M$_{&sun;}$. We show that the
median orbital eccentricities of debris are largely unchanged since
merger time, implying that this accretion event likely happened at z
{\lsim} 1.5. The exact nature of the low-e population is unclear, but we
hypothesize that it is a combination of in situ star formation, high-|z|
disc stars, lower mass accretion events, and contamination by the low-e
tail of the high-e population. Finally, our results imply that the
accretion history of the Milky Way was quite unusual.

@article{Nordlander2017b,
	Abstract = {{Context. Models of star formation in the early universe require a
detailed understanding of accretion, fragmentation and radiative
feedback in metal-free molecular clouds. Different simulations predict
different initial mass functions of the first stars, ranging from
predominantly low-mass (0.1-10 M$_{&sun;}$), to massive (10-100
M$_{&sun;}$), or even supermassive (100-1000 M$_{&sun;}$).
The mass distribution of the first stars should lead to unique chemical
imprints on the low-mass second and later generation metal-poor stars
still in existence. The chemical composition of SMSS0313-6708, which has
the lowest abundances of Ca and Fe of any star known, indicates it was
enriched by a single massive supernova. <BR /> Aims: The photospheres of
metal-poor stars are relatively transparent in the UV, which may lead to
large three-dimensional (3D) effects as well as departures from local
thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), even for weak spectral lines. If 3D
effects and departures from LTE (NLTE) are ignored or treated
incorrectly, errors in the inferred abundances may significantly bias
the inferred properties of the polluting supernovae. We redetermine the
chemical composition of SMSS0313-6708by means of the most realistic
methods available, and compare the results to predicted supernova
yields. <BR /> Methods: A 3D hydrodynamical Staggermodel atmosphere and
3D NLTE radiative transfer were applied to obtain accurate abundances
for Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca and Fe. The model atoms employ realistic
collisional rates, with no calibrated free parameters. <BR /> Results:
We find significantly higher abundances in 3D NLTE than 1D LTE by 0.8
dex for Fe, and 0.5 dex for Mg, Al and Ca, while Li and Na are
unaffected to within 0.03 dex. In particular, our upper limit for [Fe/H]
is now a factor ten larger, at [Fe/H] $\lt$ -6.53 (3{$\sigma$}), than
previous estimates based on {\mlab} 3D {\mrab}NLTE (I.e., using averaged
3D models). This higher estimate is due to a conservative upper limit
estimation, updated NLTE data, and 3D-{\mlab} 3D {\mrab}NLTE differences,
all of which lead to a higher abundance determination. <BR />
Conclusions: We find that supernova yields for models in a wide range of
progenitor masses reproduce the revised chemical composition. In
addition to massive progenitors of 20-60 M$_{&sun;}$ exploding
with low energies (1-2 B, where 1 B = 10$^{51}$ erg), we also find
good fits for progenitors of 10 M$_{&sun;}$, with very low
explosion energies ($\lt$1 B). We cannot reconcile the new abundances
with supernovae or hypernovae with explosion energies above 2.5 B, nor
with pair-instability supernovae.

	Abstract = {{The element abundance ratios of four low-mass stars with extremely low
metallicities (abundances of elements heavier than helium) indicate that
the gas out of which the stars formed was enriched in each case by at
most a few--and potentially only one--low-energy supernova. Such
supernovae yield large quantities of light elements such as carbon but
very little iron. The dominance of low-energy supernovae seems
surprising, because it had been expected that the first stars were
extremely massive, and that they disintegrated in pair-instability
explosions that would rapidly enrich galaxies in iron. What has remained
unclear is the yield of iron from the first supernovae, because hitherto
no star has been unambiguously interpreted as encapsulating the yield of
a single supernova. Here we report the optical spectrum of SMSS
J031300.36-670839.3, which shows no evidence of iron (with an upper
limit of 10$^{-7.1}$ times solar abundance). Based on a comparison
of its abundance pattern with those of models, we conclude that the star
was seeded with material from a single supernova with an original mass
about 60 times that of the Sun (and that the supernova left behind a
black hole). Taken together with the four previously mentioned
low-metallicity stars, we conclude that low-energy supernovae were
common in the early Universe, and that such supernovae yielded
light-element enrichment with insignificant iron. Reduced stellar
feedback both chemically and mechanically from low-energy supernovae
would have enabled first-generation stars to form over an extended
period. We speculate that such stars may perhaps have had an important
role in the epoch of cosmic reionization and the chemical evolution of
early galaxies.

	Abstract = {{Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting
of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on
astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than
magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided
for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. <BR /> Aims: A
summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a
discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview
of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. <BR
/> Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the
first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data
Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second
data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1
in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
products. <BR /> Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the
apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3
billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition
available. The sample of sources for which variability information is
provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains
four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the
apparent brightness in the G$_{BP}$ (330-680 nm) and
G$_{RP}$ (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources;
median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for
between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar
effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity;
and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system
epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also
represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the
optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based
solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the
photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia
DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as
independent. <BR /> Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement
for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide
parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing
a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and
source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia
survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our
galaxy.

	Abstract = {{The assembly of our Galaxy can be reconstructed using the motions and
chemistry of individual stars$^{1,2}$. Chemo-dynamical studies of
the stellar halo near the Sun have indicated the presence of multiple
components$^{3}$, such as streams$^{4}$ and
clumps$^{5}$, as well as correlations between the stars' chemical
abundances and orbital parameters$^{6-8}$. Recently, analyses of
two large stellar surveys$^{9,10}$ revealed the presence of a well
populated elemental abundance sequence$^{7,11}$, two distinct
sequences in the colour-magnitude diagram$^{12}$ and a prominent,
slightly retrograde kinematic structure$^{13,14}$ in the halo near
the Sun, which may trace an important accretion event experienced by the
Galaxy$^{15}$. However, the link between these observations and
their implications for Galactic history is not well understood. Here we
report an analysis of the kinematics, chemistry, age and spatial
distribution of stars that are mainly linked to two major Galactic
components: the thick disk and the stellar halo. We demonstrate that the
inner halo is dominated by debris from an object that at infall was
slightly more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud, and which we
refer to as Gaia-Enceladus. The stars that originate in Gaia-Enceladus
cover nearly the full sky, and their motions reveal the presence of
streams and slightly retrograde and elongated trajectories. With an
estimated mass ratio of four to one, the merger of the Milky Way with
Gaia-Enceladus must have led to the dynamical heating of the precursor
of the Galactic thick disk, thus contributing to the formation of this
component approximately ten billion years ago. These findings are in
line with the results of galaxy formation simulations, which predict
that the inner stellar halo should be dominated by debris from only a
few massive progenitors$^{2,16}$.

@article{Casey2015,
	Abstract = {{There exists an inordinate amount of spectral data in both public and
private astronomical archives that remain severely under-utilized. The
lack of reliable open-source tools for analyzing large volumes of
spectra contributes to this situation, which is poised to worsen as
large surveys successively release orders of magnitude more spectra. In
this article I introduce sick, the spectroscopic inference crank, a
flexible and fast Bayesian tool for inferring astrophysical parameters
from spectra. sick is agnostic to the wavelength coverage, resolving
power, or general data format, allowing any user to easily construct a
generative model for their data, regardless of its source. sick can be
used to provide a nearest-neighbor estimate of model parameters, a
numerically optimized point estimate, or full Markov Chain Monte Carlo
sampling of the posterior probability distributions. This generality
empowers any astronomer to capitalize on the plethora of published
synthetic and observed spectra, and make precise inferences for a host
of astrophysical (and nuisance) quantities. Model intensities can be
reliably approximated from existing grids of synthetic or observed
spectra using linear multi-dimensional interpolation, or a Cannon-based
model. Additional phenomena that transform the data (e.g., redshift,
rotational broadening, continuum, spectral resolution) are incorporated
as free parameters and can be marginalized away. Outlier pixels (e.g.,
cosmic rays or poorly modeled regimes) can be treated with a Gaussian
mixture model, and a noise model is included to account for
systematically underestimated variance. Combining these phenomena into a
scalar-justified, quantitative model permits precise inferences with
credible uncertainties on noisy data. I describe the common model
features, the implementation details, and the default behavior, which is
balanced to be suitable for most astronomical applications. Using a
forward model on low-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of
M67 stars reveals atomic diffusion processes on the order of 0.05 dex,
previously only measurable with differential analysis techniques in
high-resolution spectra. sick is easy to use, well-tested, and freely
available online through GitHub under the MIT license.

	Abstract = {{Within the Local Universe galaxies can be studied in great detail star
by star, and here we review the results of quantitative studies in
nearby dwarf galaxies. The color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is
well established as the most accurate way to determine star-formation
histories of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received
a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide-field CCD imagers
on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide.
Spectroscopic studies using large ground-based telescopes such as VLT,
Magellan, Keck, and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and
kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies.
These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can
vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to
theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of
spectroscopy and imaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy
formation and evolution is the aim of this review.

	Abstract = {{Context. The chemical evolution of neutron capture elements in the Milky
Way disc is still a matter of debate. There is a lack of statistically
significant catalogues of such element abundances, especially those of
the r-process. <BR /> Aims: We aim to understand the chemical evolution
of r-process elements in Milky Way disc. We focus on three pure
r-process elements Eu, Gd, and Dy. We also consider a pure s-process
element, Ba, in order to disentangle the different nucleosynthesis
processes. <BR /> Methods: We take advantage of high-resolution FEROS,
HARPS, and UVES spectra from the ESO archive in order to perform a
homogeneous analysis on 6500 FGK Milky Way stars. The chemical analysis
is performed thanks to the automatic optimization pipeline GAUGUIN. We
present abundances of Ba (5057 stars), Eu (6268 stars), Gd (5431 stars),
and Dy (5479 stars). Based on the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratio determined
previously by the AMBRE Project, we chemically characterize the thin and
the thick discs, and a metal-rich {$\alpha$}-rich population. <BR />
Results: First, we find that the [Eu/Fe] ratio follows a continuous
sequence from the thin disc to the thick disc as a function of the
metallicity. Second, in thick disc stars, the [Eu/Ba] ratio is found to
be constant, while the [Gd/Ba] and [Dy/Ba] ratios decrease as a function
of the metallicity. These observations clearly indicate a different
nucleosynthesis history in the thick disc between Eu and Gd-Dy. The
[r/Fe] ratio in the thin disc is roughly around +0.1 dex at solar
metallicity, which is not the case for Ba. We also find that the
{$\alpha$}-rich metal-rich stars are also enriched in r-process elements
(like thick disc stars), but their [Ba/Fe] is very different from thick
disc stars. Finally, we find that the [r/{$\alpha$}] ratio tends to
decrease with metallicity, indicating that supernovae of different
properties probably contribute differently to the synthesis of r-process
elements and {$\alpha$}-elements. <BR /> Conclusions: We provide average
abundance trends for [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] with rather small dispersions,
and for the first time for [Gd/Fe] and [Dy/Fe]. This data may help to
constrain chemical evolution models of Milky Way r- and s-process
elements and the yields of massive stars. We emphasize that including
yields of neutron-star or black hole mergers is now crucial if we want
to quantitatively compare observations to Galactic chemical evolution
models.

@article{Schuster2012,
	Abstract = {{Context. In Papers I and II of this series, we have found clear
indications of the existence of two distinct populations of stars in the
solar neighborhood belonging to the metal-rich end of the halo
metallicity distribution function. Based on high-resolution, high S/N
spectra, it is possible to distinguish between ``high-alpha'' and
``low-alpha'' components using the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagram. <BR
/> Aims: Precise relative ages and orbital parameters are determined for
67 halo and 16 thick-disk stars having metallicities in the range -1.4
$\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4 to better understand the context of the two halo
populations in the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. <BR />
Methods: Ages are derived by comparing the positions of stars in the log
T$_{eff}$-log g diagram with isochrones from the Y$^{2}$
models interpolated to the exact [Fe/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] values of each
star. The stellar parameters have been adopted from the preceding
spectroscopic analyses, but possible systematic errors in
T$_{eff}$ and log g are considered and corrected. With space
velocities from Paper I as initial conditions, orbital integrations have
been carried out using a detailed, observationally constrained
<ASTROBJ>Milky Way</ASTROBJ> model including a bar and spiral arms. <BR
/> Results: The ``high-alpha'' halo stars have ages 2-3 Gyr larger than
the ``low-alpha'' ones, with some probability that the thick-disk stars
have ages intermediate between these two halo components. The orbital
parameters show very distinct differences between the ``high-alpha'' and
``low-alpha'' halo stars. The ``low-alpha'' ones have r$_{max}$'s to
30-40 kpc, z$_{max}$'s to {\ap}18 kpc, and e$_{max}$'s
clumped at values greater than 0.85, while the ``high-alpha'' ones,
r$_{max}$'s to about 16 kpc, z$_{max}$'s to 6-8 kpc, and
e$_{max}$ values more or less uniformly distributed over 0.4-1.0.
<BR /> Conclusions: A dual in situ-plus-accretion formation scenario
best explains the existence and characteristics of these two metal-rich
halo populations, but one remaining defect is that this model is not
consistent regarding the r$_{max}$'s obtained for the in situ
``high-alpha'' component; the predicted values are too small. It appears
that <ASTROBJ>{$\omega$} Cen</ASTROBJ> may have contributed in a
significant way to the existence of the ``low-alpha'' component; recent
models, including dynamical friction and tidal stripping, have produced
results consistent with the present mass and orbital characteristics of
<ASTROBJ>{$\omega$} Cen</ASTROBJ>, while at the same time including
extremes in the orbital parameters as great as those of the ``low-alpha''
component.

	Abstract = {{While it has long been known that a large number of short-lived
transient spirals can cause stellar migration, here we report that
another mechanism is also effective at mixing disks of barred galaxies.
The resonance overlap of the bar and spiral structure (SS) induces a
nonlinear response leading to a strong redistribution of angular
momentum in the disk. We find that, depending on the amplitudes of the
perturbers, the changes in angular momentum, {$\Delta$}L, could occur up to
an order of magnitude faster than in the case of recurrent spirals. The
signature of this mechanism is a bimodality in {$\Delta$}L with maxima near
the bar's corotation and its outer Lindblad resonance; this is
independent of the properties of the SS. For parameters consistent with
the Milky Way, the disk mixes in about 3 Gyr and the stellar velocity
dispersion increases with time in a manner roughly consistent with
observations. This new mechanism could account for both the observed
age-velocity relation and the absence of age-metallicity relation in the
solar neighborhood. Spiral-bar interaction could also explain
observations showing that strongly barred galaxies have weaker
metallicity gradients than weakly barred or non-barred galaxies.

km s$^{-1}$), low-mass giant stars in the Apache Point
Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment-Kepler (APOKASC) fields with
asteroseismic mass and surface gravity measurements. Such stars are
likely merger products and their frequency places interesting
constraints on stellar population models. We also identify anomalous
rotators, i.e., stars with 5 km s$^{-1}$ $\lt$ v$\{$sin$\}$i $\lt$
10 km s$^{-1}$ that are rotating significantly faster than
both angular momentum evolution predictions and the measured rates of
similar stars. Our data set contains fewer rapid rotators than one would
expect given measurements of the Galactic field star population, which
likely indicates that asteroseismic detections are less common in
rapidly rotating red giants. The number of low-mass moderate (5-10
km s$^{-1}$) rotators in our sample gives a lower limit of
7\% for the rate at which low-mass stars interact on the upper red giant
branch because single stars in this mass range are expected to rotate
slowly. Finally, we classify the likely origin of the rapid or anomalous
rotation where possible. KIC 10293335 is identified as a merger product

	Abstract = {{We measure chemical abundance ratios and radial velocities in four
massive (I.e. young) [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich red giant stars using
high-resolution high-S/N spectra from ESPaDOnS fed by Gemini-GRACES. Our
differential analysis ensures that our chemical abundances are on the
same scale as the Alves-Brito et al. (2010) study of bulge, thin, and
thick disc red giants. We confirm that the program stars have enhanced
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios and are slightly metal poor. Aside from lithium
enrichment in one object, the program stars exhibit no chemical
abundance anomalies when compared to giant stars of similar metallicity
throughout the Galaxy. This includes the elements Li, O, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr,
Ni, Cu, Ba, La, and Eu. Therefore, there are no obvious chemical
signatures that can help to reveal the origin of these unusual stars.
While our new observations show that only one star (not the Li-rich
object) exhibits a radial velocity variation, simulations indicate that
we cannot exclude the possibility that all four could be binaries. In
addition, we find that two (possibly three) stars show evidence for an
infrared excess, indicative of a debris disc. This is consistent with
these young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars being evolved blue stragglers,
suggesting their apparent young age is a consequence of a merger or mass
transfer. We would expect a binary fraction of {\tilde}50 per cent or
greater for the entire sample of these stars, but the signs of the
circumbinary disc may have been lost since these features can have short
time-scales. Radial velocity monitoring is needed to confirm the blue
straggler origin.

	Abstract = {{Knowledge of the supernova (SN) delay time distribution (DTD){\mdash}the
SN rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star
formation{\mdash}can shed light on SN progenitors and physics, as well as
on the timescales of chemical enrichment in different environments. We
compile recent measurements of the Type-Ia SN (SN Ia) rate in galaxy
clusters at redshifts from z = 0 out to z = 1.45, just 2 Gyr after
cluster star formation at z {\ap} 3. We review the plausible range for
the observed total iron-to-stellar mass ratio in clusters, based on the
latest data and analyses, and use it to constrain the time-integrated
number of SN Ia events in clusters. With these data, we recover the DTD
of SNe Ia in cluster environments. The DTD is sharply peaked at the
shortest time-delay interval we probe, 0Gyr $\lt$ t $\lt$ 2.2 Gyr, with a
low tail out to delays of \~{}10 Gyr, and is remarkably consistent with
several recent DTD reconstructions based on different methods, applied
to different environments. We test DTD models from the literature,
requiring that they simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster SN
rates and the observed iron-to-stellar mass ratios. A parameterized
power-law DTD of the form t $^{-1.2$\pm$0.3}$ from t = 400 Myr
to a Hubble time can satisfy both constraints. Shallower power laws such
as t $^{-1/2}$ cannot, assuming a single DTD, and a single star
formation burst (either brief or extended) at high z. This implies that
50\%-85\% of SNe Ia explode within 1 Gyr of star formation. DTDs from
double-degenerate (DD) models, which generically have \~{}t $^{-1}$
shapes over a wide range of timescales, match the data, but only if
their predictions are scaled up by factors of 5-10. Single-degenerate
(SD) DTDs always give poor fits to the data, due to a lack of delayed
SNe and overall low numbers of SNe. The observations can also be
reproduced with a combination of two SN Ia populations{\mdash}a prompt SD
population of SNe Ia that explodes within a few Gyr of star formation,
and produces about 60\% of the iron mass in clusters, and a DD population
that contributes the events seen at z $\lt$ 1.5. An alternative scenario
of a single, prompt, SN Ia population, but a composite star formation
history in clusters, consisting of a burst at high z, followed by a
constant star formation rate, can reproduce the SN rates, but is at odds
with direct measurements of star formation in clusters at 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$
1. Our results support the existence of a DD progenitor channel for SNe
Ia, if the overall predicted numbers can be suitably increased.

	Abstract = {{Efficient spectrographs at large telescopes have made it possible to
obtain high-resolution spectra of stars with high signal-to-noise ratio
and advances in model atmosphere analyses have enabled estimates of
high-precision differential abundances of the elements from these
spectra, i.e. with errors in the range 0.01-0.03 dex for F, G, and K
stars. Methods to determine such high-precision abundances together with
precise values of effective temperatures and surface gravities from
equivalent widths of spectral lines or by spectrum synthesis techniques
are outlined, and effects on abundance determinations from using a 3D
non-LTE analysis instead of a classical 1D LTE analysis are considered.
The determination of high-precision stellar abundances of the elements
has led to the discovery of unexpected phenomena and relations with
important bearings on the astrophysics of galaxies, stars, and planets,
i.e. (i) Existence of discrete stellar populations within each of the
main Galactic components (disk, halo, and bulge) providing new
constraints on models for the formation of the Milky Way. (ii)
Differences in the relation between abundances and elemental
condensation temperature for the Sun and solar twins suggesting
dust-cleansing effects in proto-planetary disks and/or engulfment of
planets by stars; (iii) Differences in chemical composition between
binary star components and between members of open or globular clusters
showing that star- and cluster-formation processes are more complicated
than previously thought; (iv) Tight relations between some abundance
ratios and age for solar-like stars providing new constraints on
nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution models as well as the
composition of terrestrial exoplanets. We conclude that if stellar
abundances with precisions of 0.01-0.03 dex can be achieved in studies
of more distant stars and stars on the giant and supergiant branches,
many more interesting future applications, of great relevance to stellar
and galaxy evolution, are probable. Hence, in planning abundance
surveys, it is important to carefully balance the need for large samples
of stars against the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio
needed to obtain high-precision abundances. Furthermore, it is an
advantage to work differentially on stars with similar atmospheric
parameters, because then a simple 1D LTE analysis of stellar spectra may
be sufficient. However, when determining high-precision absolute
abundances or differential abundance between stars having more widely
different parameters, e.g. metal-poor stars compared to the Sun or
giants to dwarfs, then 3D non-LTE effects must be taken into account.

	Abstract = {{Many stellar models present difficulties in reproducing basic
observational relations of very low mass stars (VLMS), including the
mass-radius relation and the optical colour-magnitudes of cool dwarfs.
Here, we improve PARSEC (PAdova-TRieste Stellar Evolution Code) models
on these points. We implement the T- {$\tau$} relations from PHOENIX
BT-Settl model atmospheres as the outer boundary conditions in the
PARSEC code, finding that this change alone reduces the discrepancy in
the mass-radius relation from 8 to 5 per cent. We compare the models
with multiband photometry of clusters Praesepe and M67, showing that the
use of T- {$\tau$} relations clearly improves the description of the
optical colours and magnitudes. But anyway, using both Kurucz and
PHOENIX model spectra, model colours are still systematically fainter
and bluer than the observations. We then apply a shift to the above T-
{$\tau$} relations, increasing from 0 at T$_{eff}$ = 4730 K to
{\tilde}14 per cent at T$_{eff}$ = 3160 K, to reproduce the
observed mass-radius relation of dwarf stars. Taking this experiment as
a calibration of the T- {$\tau$} relations, we can reproduce the optical
and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of low-mass stars in the old
metal-poor globular clusters NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc, and in the
intermediate-age and young solar-metallicity open clusters M67 and
Praesepe. Thus, we extend PARSEC models using this calibration,
providing VLMS models more suitable for the lower main-sequence stars
over a wide range of metallicities and wavelengths. Both sets of models
are available on PARSEC webpage.

	Abstract = {{We complement the PARSEC data base of stellar evolutionary tracks with
new models of massive stars, from the pre-main-sequence phase to the
central carbon ignition. We consider a broad range of metallicities,
0.0001 {\le} Z {\le} 0.04 and initial masses up to M$_{ini}$ = 350
M$_{&sun;}$. The main difference with respect to our previous
models of massive stars is the adoption of a recent formalizm accounting
for the mass-loss enhancement when the ratio of the stellar to the
Eddington luminosity, {$\Gamma$}$_{e}$, approaches unity. With this
new formalizm, the models are able to reproduce the Humphreys-Davidson
limit observed in the Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud
colour-magnitude diagrams, without an ad hoc mass-loss enhancement. We
also follow the predictions of recent wind models indicating that the
metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rates becomes shallower when
{$\Gamma$}$_{e}$ approaches unity. We thus find that the more massive
stars may suffer from substantial mass-loss even at low metallicity. We
also predict that the Humphreys-Davidson limit should become brighter at
decreasing metallicity. We supplement the evolutionary tracks with new
tables of theoretical bolometric corrections, useful to compare tracks
and isochrones with the observations. For this purpose, we homogenize
existing stellar atmosphere libraries of hot and cool stars (Potsdam
Wolf-Rayet, ATLAS9 and PHOENIX) and we add, where needed, new atmosphere
models computed with WM-BASIC. The mass, age and metallicity grids are
fully adequate to perform detailed investigations of the properties of
very young stellar systems, both in local and distant galaxies. The new
tracks supersede the previous old PADOVA models of massive stars.

	Abstract = {{We extend the PARSEC library of stellar evolutionary tracks by computing
new models of massive stars, from 14 to 350 M$_{&sun;}$. The input
physics is the same used in the PARSEC V1.1 version, but for the
mass-loss rate from considering the most recent updates in the
literature. We focus on low metallicity, Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.004, for
which the metal-poor dwarf irregular star-forming galaxies, Sextans A,
the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte galaxy and NGC 6822, provide simple but
powerful workbenches. The models reproduce fairly well the observed
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) but the stellar colour distributions
indicate that the predicted blue loop is not hot enough in models with a
canonical extent of overshooting. In the framework of a mild extended
mixing during central hydrogen burning, the only way to reconcile the
discrepancy is to enhance the overshooting at the base of the convective
envelope (EO) during the first dredge-up. The mixing scales required to
reproduce the observed loops, EO = 2H$_{P}$ or EO =
4H$_{P}$, are definitely larger than those derived from, e.g. the
observed location of the red-giant-branch bump in low mass stars. This
effect, if confirmed, would imply a strong dependence of the mixing
scale below the formal Schwarzschild border, on the stellar mass or
luminosity. Reproducing the features of the observed CMDs with standard
values of envelope overshooting would require a metallicity
significantly lower than the values measured in these galaxies. Other
quantities, such as the star formation rate and the initial mass
function, are only slightly sensitive to this effect. Future
investigations will consider other metallicities and different mixing
schemes.

	Abstract = {{Using the astrometry from the ESA's Gaia mission, previous works have
shown that the Milky Way stellar halo is dominated by metal-rich stars
on highly eccentric orbits. To shed light on the nature of this
prominent halo component, we have analysed 28 Galaxy analogues in the
Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamics zoom-in simulations. Some
three quarters of the Auriga galaxies contain significant components
with high radial velocity anisotropy, beta $\gt$ 0.6. However, only in
one third of the hosts do the high-beta stars contribute significantly
to the accreted stellar halo overall, similar to what is observed in the
Milky Way. For this particular subset we reveal the origin of the
dominant stellar halo component with high metallicity, [Fe/H]\~{}-1, and
high orbital anisotropy, beta$\gt$0.8, by tracing their stars back to the
epoch of accretion. It appears that, typically, these stars come from a
single dwarf galaxy with a stellar mass of order of 10\^{}9-10\^{}10 Msol that
merged around 6-10 Gyr ago, causing a sharp increase in the halo mass.
Our study therefore establishes a firm link between the excess of
radially anisotropic stellar debris in the Milky Way halo and an ancient
head-on collision between the young Milky Way and a massive dwarf galaxy

metallicity as a secondary check. This is validated against smooth
models and numerical constructed stellar haloes from the Aquarius
simulations. We identify 21 substructures in the SDSS-Gaia catalogue,
including seven high-significance, high-energy and retrograde ones. We
investigate whether the retrograde substructures may be material
stripped off the atypical globular cluster {$\omega$} Centauri. Using a
simple model of the accretion of the progenitor of the {$\omega$} Centauri,
we tentatively argue for the possible association of up to five of our
new substructures (labelled Rg1, Rg3, Rg4, Rg6 and Rg7) with this event.
This sets a minimum mass of 5 {\times} 10$^{8}$ M$_{&sun;}$
for the progenitor, so as to bring {$\omega$} Centauri to its current
location in action-energy space. Our proposal can be tested by
high-resolution spectroscopy of the candidates to look for the unusual
abundance patterns possessed by {$\omega$} Centauri stars.

	Abstract = {{We analyze the structure of the local stellar halo of the Milky Way
using {\tilde}60000 stars with full phase space coordinates extracted from
the SDSS-Gaia catalog. We display stars in action space as a
function of metallicity in a realistic axisymmetric potential for the
Milky Way Galaxy. The metal-rich population is more distended toward
high radial action J $_{ R }$ as compared to azimuthal or vertical
action, J $_{ varphi }$ or J $_{ z }$. It has a mild
prograde rotation ($\lt$ $\{$v$\}$$_{phi }$$\gt$ {\ap} 25 $\{$km$\}$
$\{$$\{$$\{$s$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$), is radially anisotropic and highly flattened,
with axis ratio q {\ap} 0.6-0.7. The metal-poor population is more
evenly distributed in all three actions. It has larger prograde rotation
($\lt$ $\{$v$\}$$_{phi }$$\gt$ {\ap} 50 $\{$km$\}$ $\{$$\{$$\{$s$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$), a
mild radial anisotropy, and a roundish morphology (q {\ap} 0.9). We
identify two further components of the halo in action space. There is a
high-energy, retrograde component that is only present in the metal-rich
stars. This is suggestive of an origin in a retrograde encounter,
possibly the one that created the stripped dwarf galaxy nucleus,
{$\omega$}Centauri. Also visible as a distinct entity in action space is a
resonant component, which is flattened and prograde. It extends over a
range of metallicities down to [Fe/H] {\ap} -3. It has a net
outward radial velocity $\lt$ $\{$v$\}$$_{R}$$\gt$ {\ap} 12 $\{$km$\}$
$\{$$\{$$\{$s$\}$$\}$$\}$$^{-1}$ within the solar circle at | z| $\lt$ 3.5 $\{$kpc$\}$. The
existence of resonant stars at such extremely low metallicities has not
been seen before.

	Abstract = {{We use the age-metallicity distribution of 96 Galactic globular clusters
(GCs) to infer the formation and assembly history of the Milky Way (MW),
culminating in the reconstruction of its merger tree. Based on a
quantitative comparison of the Galactic GC population to the 25
cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW-mass galaxies in the E-MOSAICS
project, which self-consistently model the formation and evolution of GC
populations in a cosmological context, we find that the MW assembled
quickly for its mass, reaching $\{$25, 50$\}$\% of its present-day halo mass
already at z = $\{$3, 1.5$\}$ and half of its present-day stellar mass at z =
1.2. We reconstruct the MW's merger tree from its GC age-metallicity
distribution, inferring the number of mergers as a function of mass
ratio and redshift. These statistics place the MW's assembly rate among
the 72th-94th percentile of the E-MOSAICS galaxies, whereas its
integrated properties (e.g. number of mergers, halo concentration) match
the median of the simulations. We conclude that the MW has experienced
no major mergers (mass ratios $\gt$1:4) since z {\tilde} 4, sharpening
previous limits of z {\tilde} 2. We identify three massive satellite
progenitors and constrain their mass growth and enrichment histories.
Two are proposed to correspond to Sagittarius (few
10$^{8}$M$_{&sun;}$) and Canis Major ({\tilde}10$^{9}$
M$_{&sun;}$). The third satellite has no known associated relic
and was likely accreted between z = 0.6-1.3. We name this enigmatic
galaxy Kraken and propose that it is the most massive satellite
(M$_{*}$ {\tilde} 2 {\times} 10$^{9}$ M$_{&sun;}$) ever
accreted by the MW. We predict that {\tilde}40\% of the Galactic GCs
formed ex-situ (in galaxies with masses M$_{*}$ = 2 {\times}
10$^{7}$-2 {\times} 10$^{9}$ M$_{&sun;}$), with 6

	Abstract = {{We report the discovery of a group of apparently young CoRoT red-giant
stars exhibiting enhanced [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundance ratios (as determined
from APOGEE spectra) with respect to solar values. Their existence is
not explained bystandard chemical evolution models of the Milky Way, and
shows that the chemical-enrichment history of the Galactic disc is more
complex. We find similar stars in previously published samples for which
isochrone-ages could be reliably obtained, although in smaller relative
numbers. This might explain why these stars have not previously received
attention. The young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are much more numerous in
the CoRoT-APOGEE (CoRoGEE) inner-field sample than in any other
high-resolution sample available at present because only CoRoGEE can
explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. The
kinematic properties of the young [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-rich stars are not
clearly thick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the
Galactic mid-plane. Our tentative interpretation of these and previous
intriguing observations in the Milky Way is that these stars were formed
close to the end of the Galactic bar, near corotation - a region where
gas can be kept inert for longer times than in other regions that are
more frequently shocked by the passage of spiral arms. Moreover, this is
where the mass return from older inner-disc stellar generations is
expected to be highest (according to an inside-out disc-formation
scenario), which additionally dilutes the in-situ gas. Other
possibilities to explain these observations (e.g., a recent
gas-accretion event) are also discussed.

@article{Bensby2013,
	Abstract = {{Based on high-resolution spectra obtained during gravitational
microlensing events we present a detailed elemental abundance analysis
of 32 dwarf and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge. Combined with the
sample of 26 stars from the previous papers in this series, we now have
58 microlensed bulge dwarfs and subgiants that have been homogeneously
analysed. The main characteristics of the sample and the findings that
can be drawn are: (i) the metallicity distribution (MDF) is wide and
spans all metallicities between [Fe/H] = -1.9 to +0.6; (ii) the dip in
the MDF around solar metallicity that was apparent in our previous
analysis of a smaller sample (26 microlensed stars) is no longer
evident; instead it has a complex structure and indications of multiple
components are starting to emerge. A tentative interpretation is that
there could be different stellar populations at interplay, each with a
different scale height: the thin disk, the thick disk, and a bar
population; (iii) the stars with [Fe/H] {\lsim} -0.1 are old with ages
between 10 and 12 Gyr; (iv) the metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] {\gsim} -0.1
show a wide variety of ages, ranging from 2 to 12 Gyr with a
distribution that has a dominant peak around 4-5 Gyr and a tail towards
higher ages; (v) there are indications in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-[Fe/H]
abundance trends that the ``knee'' occurs around [Fe/H] = -0.3to -0.2,
which is a slightly higher metallicity as compared to the ``knee'' for the
local thick disk. This suggests that the chemical enrichment of the
metal-poor bulge has been somewhat faster than what is observed for the
local thick disk. The results from the microlensed bulge dwarf stars in
combination with other findings in the literature, in particular the
evidence that the bulge has cylindrical rotation, indicate that the
Milky Way could be an almost pure disk galaxy. The bulge would then just
be a conglomerate of the other Galactic stellar populations (thin disk,
thick disk, halo, and ...?), residing together in the central parts of
the Galaxy, influenced by the Galactic bar.

	Abstract = {{We present a detailed elemental abundance study of 90 F and G dwarf,
turn-off, and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge. Based on
high-resolution spectra acquired during gravitational microlensing
events, stellar ages and abundances for 11 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca,
Ti, Cr, Fe, Zn, Y and Ba) have been determined. Four main findings are
presented: (1) a wide metallicity distribution with distinct peaks at
[Fe/H] = -1.09, -0.63, -0.20, + 0.12, + 0.41; (2) ahigh fraction of
intermediate-age to young stars where at [Fe/H] $\gt$ 0 more than 35\% are
younger than 8 Gyr, and for [Fe/H] {\lsim} -0.5 most stars are 10 Gyr or
older; (3) several episodes of significant star formation in the bulge
has been identified: 3, 6, 8, and 11 Gyr ago; (4) tentatively the ``knee''
in the {$\alpha$}-element abundance trends of the sub-solar metallicity
bulge is located at a slightly higher [Fe/H] than in the local thick
disk. These findings show that the Galactic bulge has complex age and
abundance properties that appear to be tightly connected to the main
Galactic stellar populations. In particular, the peaks in the
metallicity distribution, the star formation episodes, and the abundance
trends, show similarities with the properties of the Galactic thin and
thick disks. At the same time, the star formation rate appears to have
been slightly faster in the bulge than in the local thick disk, which
most likely is an indication of the denser stellar environment closer to
the Galactic centre. There are also additional components not seen
outside the bulge region, and that most likely can be associated with
the Galactic bar. Our results strengthen the observational evidence that
support the idea of a secular origin for the Galactic bulge, formed out
of the other main Galactic stellar populations present in the central
regions of our Galaxy. Additionally, our analysis of this enlarged
sample suggests that the (V-I)$_{0}$ colour of the bulge red clump
should be revised to 1.09.

	Abstract = {{A deep understanding of the Milky Way galaxy, its formation and
evolution requires observations of large numbers of stars. Stellar
photometry provides an economical method to obtain intrinsic stellar
parameters. With the addition of distance information -- a prospect made
real for more than a billion stars with the second Gaia data release --
deriving reliable ages from photometry is a possibility. We developed a
Bayesian method to generate 2D probability maps of a star's age and
metallicity from photometry and parallax using isochrones. Our synthetic
tests show that colours in the optical or near-infrared cannot by
themselves provide unique ages and metallicities due to strong
degeneracy between the two parameters. Including a near-UV passband
enables us to break this degeneracy for many types of stars. It is
possible to find well-constrained ages and metallicities for turn-off
and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band and a parallax with
an uncertainty less than approximately 20\%. Metallicities alone are
possible for the main sequence and giant branch. We attempted to recover
ages and metallicities from real data, using the Gaia benchmark stars
and the old open cluster NGC 188. This revealed significant limitations
in the stellar isochrones. The ages of the cluster stars varied with
evolutionary stage, such that turn-off ages were discrepant with those
on the sub-giant branch and metallicities varied significantly
throughout the HR diagram. Most importantly, the parameters varied
appreciably depending on which colour combinations were used in the
derivation. We conclude that there exists a noticeable mismatch between
the photometry from isochrones and those from observations. Our results
here are a warning to those applying isochrone ages indiscriminately.
Further efforts to improve the models will result in significant
advances in our ability to study the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{In the age of high-resolution spectroscopic stellar surveys of the Milky
Way, the number of stars with detailed abundances of multiple elements
is rapidly increasing. These elemental abundances are directly
influenced by the evolutionary history of the Galaxy, but this can be
difficult to interpret without an absolute timeline of the abundance
enrichment. We present age-abundance trends for [M/H], [{$\alpha$}/M], and
17 individual elements using a sample of 721 solar neighbourhood
Hipparcos red giant stars observed by Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment. These age trends are determined through a Bayesian
hierarchical modelling method presented by Feuillet et al. We confirm
that the [{$\alpha$}/M]-age relation in the solar neighbourhood is steep
and relatively narrow (0.20 dex age dispersion), as are the [O/M]-age
and [Mg/M]-age relations. The age trend of [C/N] is steep and smooth,
consistent with stellar evolution. The [M/H]-age relation has a mean age
dispersion of 0.28 dex and a complex overall structure. The oldest stars
in our sample are those with the lowest and highest metallicities, while
the youngest stars are those with solar metallicity. These results
provide strong constraints on theoretical models of Galactic chemical
evolution (GCE). We compare them to the predictions of one-zone GCE
models and multizone mixtures, both analytic and numerical. These
comparisons support the hypothesis that the solar neighbourhood is
composed of stars born at a range of Galactocentric radii, and that the
most metal-rich stars likely migrated from a region with earlier and
more rapid star formation such as the inner Galaxy.

@article{Spitoni2009,
	Abstract = {{Context: The majority of galactic chemical evolution models assumes the
        instantaneous mixing approximation (IMA). This assumption is
        probably not realistic, as indicated by the existence of
        chemical inhomogeneities, although current chemical evolution
        models of the Milky Way can reproduce the majority of the
        observational constraints under the IMA. <BR />Aims: The aim of
        this paper is to test whether relaxing this approximation in a
        detailed chemical evolution model can improve or worsen the
        agreement with observations. To do that, we investigated two
        possible causes for relaxing of the instantaneous mixing: i) the
        {\textquotedblleft}galactic fountain time delay
        effect{\textquotedblright} and ii) the {\textquotedblleft}metal
        cooling time delay effect{\textquotedblright}. <BR />Methods: We
        considered various galactic fountain time delays for the
        chemical enrichment from massive stars. We then tested a time
        delay in the enrichment from stars of all masses due to gas
        cooling in the range 0.5-1 Gyr. <BR />Results: We found that the
        effect of galactic fountains is negligible if an average time
        delay of 0.1 Gyr, as suggested in a previous paper, is assumed.
        Longer time delays produce differences in the results but they
        are not realistic. We also found that the O abundance gradient
        in the disk is not affected by galactic fountains. The metal
        cooling time delays produce strong effects on the evolution of
        the chemical abundances only if we adopt stellar yields
        depending on metallicity. If, instead, the yields computed for
        the solar chemical composition are adopted, negligible effects
        are produced, as in the case of the galactic fountain delay. <BR
        />Conclusions: The relaxation of the IMA by means of the
        galactic fountain model, where the delay is considered only for
        massive stars and only in the disk, does not affect the chemical
        evolution results. The combination of metal dependent yields and
        time delay in the chemical enrichment from all stars starting
        from the halo phase, instead, produces results at variance with
        observations.}},

@article{Chiappini2001,
	Abstract = {{In this paper we adopt a chemical evolution model, which is an improved
        version of the Chiappini, Matteucci, \&amp; Gratton model,
        assuming two main accretion episodes for the formation of the
        Galaxy, the first forming the halo and bulge in a short
        timescale and the second one forming the thin disk, with a
        timescale that is an increasing function of the Galactocentric
        distance (being of the order of 7 Gyrs at the solar
        neighborhood). The present model takes into account in more
        detail than previously the halo density distribution and
        explores the effects of a threshold density in the star
        formation process during both the halo and disk phases. The
        model also includes the most recent nucleosynthesis
        prescriptions concerning supernovae of all types, novae, and
        single stars dying as white dwarfs. In the comparison between
        model predictions and available data, we have focused our
        attention on abundance gradients as well as gas, stellar, and
        star formation rate distributions along the disk, since this
        kind of model has already proven to be quite successful in
        reproducing the solar neighborhood characteristics. We suggest
        that the mechanism for the formation of the halo leaves
        detectable imprints on the chemical properties of the outer
        regions of the disk, whereas the evolution of the halo and the
        inner disk are almost completely disentangled. This is due to
        the fact that the halo and disk densities are comparable at
        large Galactocentric distances and therefore the gas lost from
        the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outer
        disk. We also show that the existence of a threshold density for
        the star formation rate, both in the halo and disk phase, is
        necessary to reproduce the majority of observational data in the
        solar vicinity and in the whole disk. In particular, a threshold
        in the star formation implies the occurrence of a gap in the
        star formation at the halo-disk transition phase, in agreement
        with recent data. We conclude that a relatively short halo
        formation timescale (\textasciitilde=0.8 Gyr), in agreement with
        recent estimates for the age differences among Galactic globular
        clusters, coupled with an ``inside-out'' formation of the
        Galactic disk, where the innermost regions are assumed to have
        formed much faster than the outermost ones, represents, at the
        moment, the most likely explanation for the formation of the
        Milky Way. This scenario allows us to predict abundance
        gradients and other radial properties of the Galactic disk in
        very good agreement with observations. Moreover, as a
        consequence of the adopted ``inside-out'' scenario for the disk,
        we predict that the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk
        must have increased with time and that the average
        \&lt;[{\ensuremath{\alpha}}/Fe]\&gt; ratios in stars (halo plus
        disk) slightly decrease going from 4 to 10 kpcs from the
        Galactic center. We also show that the same ratios increase
        substantially toward the outermost disk regions and the expected
        scatter in the stellar ages decreases, because the outermost
        regions are dominated by halo stars. More observations at large
        Galactocentric distances are needed to test these predictions.}},

	Abstract = {{Context. Galactic chemical evolution models are useful tools for
        interpreting the large body of high-quality observational data
        on the chemical composition of stars and gas in galaxies that
        have become available in recent years. <BR /> Aims: This is the
        second paper of a series that aims at quantifying the
        uncertainties in chemical evolution model predictions related to
        the underlying model assumptions. Specifically, it deals with
        the uncertainties due to the choice of the stellar yields. <BR
        /> Methods: We adopted a widely used model for the chemical
        evolution of the Galaxy to test the effects of changing the
        stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution
        of several chemical species. Up-to-date results from stellar
        evolutionary models were carefully taken into account. <BR />
        Results: We find that, except for a handful of elements whose
        nucleosynthesis in stars is well understood by now, large
        uncertainties still affect model predictions. This is especially
        true for the majority of the iron-peak elements, but also for
        much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen. The main
        causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different
        models assuming different stellar yields and among model
        predictions and observations are (i) the adopted location of the
        mass cut in models of type II supernova explosions; (ii) the
        adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning in models of
        asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the
        effects of rotation on the chemical composition of the stellar
        surfaces; (iv) the adopted rates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear
        reactions; and (vi) the different treatments of convection. <BR
        /> Conclusions: Our results suggest that it is mandatory to
        include processes such as hot bottom burning in intermediate-
        mass stars and rotation in stars of all masses in accurate

13 and 14 are described, highlighting differences from the DR12 analysis
presented in Holtzman et al. Some improvement in the handling of
telluric absorption and persistence is demonstrated. The derivation and
calibration of stellar parameters, chemical abundances, and respective
uncertainties are described, along with the ranges over which
calibration was performed. Some known issues with the public data
related to the calibration of the effective temperatures (DR13), surface
gravity (DR13 and DR14), and C and N abundances for dwarfs (DR13 and
DR14) are highlighted. We discuss how results from a data-driven
technique, The Cannon, are included in DR14 and compare those with
results from the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundances
Pipeline. We describe how using The Cannon in a mode that restricts the
abundance analysis of each element to regions of the spectrum with known
features from that element leads to Cannon abundances can lead to
significantly different results for some elements than when all regions
of the spectrum are used to derive abundances.

	Abstract = {{Hydrogen Balmer lines are commonly used as spectroscopic effective
temperature diagnostics of late-type stars. However, reliable inferences
require accurate model spectra, and the absolute accuracy of classical
methods that are based on one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model
atmospheres and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is still unclear.
To investigate this, we carry out 3D non-LTE calculations for the Balmer
lines, performed, for the first time, over an extensive grid of 3D
hydrodynamic STAGGER model atmospheres. For H{$\alpha$}, H{$\beta$}, and
H{$\gamma$} we find significant 1D non-LTE versus 3D non-LTE differences
(3D effects): the outer wings tend to be stronger in 3D models,
particularly for H{$\gamma$}, while the inner wings can be weaker in 3D
models, particularly for H{$\alpha$}. For H{$\alpha$}, we also find
significant 3D LTE versus 3D non-LTE differences (non-LTE effects): in
warmer stars (T$_{eff}$ {\ap} 6500 K) the inner wings tend to be
weaker in non-LTE models, while at lower effective temperatures
(T$_{eff}$ {\ap} 4500 K) the inner wings can be stronger in non-LTE
models; the non-LTE effects are more severe at lower metallicities. We
test our 3D non-LTE models against observations of well-studied
benchmark stars. For the Sun, we infer concordant effective temperatures
from H{$\alpha$}, H{$\beta$}, and H{$\gamma$}; however the value is too low by
around 50 K which could signal residual modelling shortcomings. For
other benchmark stars, our 3D non-LTE models generally reproduce the
effective temperatures to within 1{$\sigma$} uncertainties. For H{$\alpha$},
the absolute 3D effects and non-LTE effects can separately reach around
100 K, in terms of inferred effective temperatures. For metal-poor
turn-off stars, 1D LTE models of H{$\alpha$} can underestimate effective
temperatures by around 150 K. Our 3D non-LTE model spectra are publicly
available, and can be used for more reliable spectroscopic effective
temperature determinations.

	Abstract = {{Using GALAH (GALactic Archaeology with HERMES) survey data of nearby
stars, we look at how structure in the planar (u, v) velocity
distribution depends on metallicity and on viewing direction within the
Galaxy. In nearby stars with distance d {\lsim} 1 kpc, the Hercules
stream is most strongly seen in higher metallicity stars [Fe/H] $\gt$
0.2. The Hercules stream peak v value depends on viewed galactic
longitude, which we interpret as due to the gap between the stellar
stream and more circular orbits being associated with a specific angular
momentum value of about 1640 km s$^{-1}$ kpc. The association of
the gap with a particular angular momentum value supports a bar resonant
model for the Hercules stream. Moving groups previously identified in
Hipparcos(HIgh Precision Parallax COllecting Satellite) observations are
easiest to see in stars nearer than 250 pc, and their visibility and
peak velocities in the velocity distributions depends on both viewing
direction (galactic longitude and hemisphere) and metallicity. We infer
that there is fine structure in local velocity distributions that varies
over distances of a few hundred pc in the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{Open cluster members are coeval and share the same initial bulk chemical
composition. Consequently, differences in surface abundances between
members of a cluster that are at different evolutionary stages can be
used to study the effects of mixing and internal chemical processing. We
carry out an abundance analysis of seven elements (Li, O, Na, Mg, Al,
Si, and Fe) in 66 stars belonging to the open cluster M67, based on high
resolution GALAH spectra, 1D MARCS model atmospheres, and non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer. From the non-LTE
analysis, we find a typical star-to-star scatter in the abundance ratios
of around 0.05 dex. We find trends in the abundance ratios with
effective temperature, indicating systematic differences in the surface
abundances between turn-off and giant stars; these trends are more
pronounced when LTE is assumed. However, trends with effective
temperature remain significant for Al and Si also in non-LTE. Finally,
we compare the derived abundances with prediction from stellar evolution
models including effects of atomic diffusion. We find overall good
agreement for the abundance patterns of dwarfs and sub-giant stars, but
the abundances of cool giants are lower relative to less evolved stars
than predicted by the diffusion models, in particular for Mg.

	Abstract = {{We combine parallaxes from the first Gaia data release with the
spectrophotometric distance estimation framework for stars in the fifth
RAVE survey data release. The combined distance estimates are more
accurate than either determination in isolation - uncertainties are on
average two times smaller than for RAVE-only distances (three times
smaller for dwarfs), and 1.4 times smaller than TGAS parallax
uncertainties (two times smaller for giants). We are also able to
compare the estimates from spectrophotometry to those from Gaia, and use
this to assess the reliability of both catalogues and improve our
distance estimates. We find that the distances to the lowest log g stars
are, on average, overestimated and caution that they may not be
reliable. We also find that it is likely that the Gaia random
uncertainties are smaller than the reported values. As a by-product we
derive ages for the RAVE stars, many with relative uncertainties less
than 20 per cent. These results for 219 566 RAVE sources have been made
publicly available, and we encourage their use for studies that combine
the radial velocities provided by RAVE with the proper motions provided
by Gaia. A sample that we believe to be reliable can be found by taking

	Abstract = {{The Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey is a large-scale
stellar spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way, designed to deliver
complementary chemical information to a large number of stars covered by
the Gaia mission. We present the GALAH second public data release (GALAH
DR2) containing 342 682 stars. For these stars, the GALAH collaboration
provides stellar parameters and abundances for up to 23 elements to the
community. Here we present the target selection, observation, data
reduction, and detailed explanation of how the spectra were analysed to
estimate stellar parameters and element abundances. For the stellar
analysis, we have used a multistep approach. We use the physics-driven
spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to derive stellar
labels (T$_{eff}$, log g, [Fe/H], [X/Fe], v$_{mic}$, vsin i,
A\_$\{$K\_S$\}$) for a representative training set of stars. This information is
then propagated to the whole sample with the data-driven method of The
Cannon. Special care has been exercised in the spectral synthesis to
only consider spectral lines that have reliable atomic input data and
are little affected by blending lines. Departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for several key elements,
including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS stellar
atmosphere models. Validation tests including repeat observations, Gaia
benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic
targets lend confidence to our methods and results. Combining the GALAH
DR2 catalogue with the kinematic information from Gaia will enable a
wide range of Galactic Archaeology studies, with unprecedented detail,
dimensionality, and scope.

	Abstract = {Ongoing surveys are in the process of measuring the chemical abundances
in large numbers of stars, with the ultimate goal of reconstructing the
formation history of the Milky Way using abundances as tracers. However,
interpretation of these data requires that we understand the
relationship between stellar distributions in chemical and physical
space. We investigate this question by simulating the gravitational
collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud extracted from a galaxy-scale
simulation, seeded with chemical inhomogeneities with different initial
spatial scales. We follow the collapse from galactic scales down to
resolutions scales of {\ap}10$^{-3}$ pc, and find that, during this
process, turbulence mixes the metal patterns, reducing the abundance
scatter initially present in the gas by an amount that depends on the
initial scale of inhomogeneity of each metal field. However, we find
that regardless of the spatial structure of the metals at the onset of
collapse, the final stellar abundances are highly correlated only on
distances below a few pc. Consequently, the star formation process
defines a natural size scale of {\tilde}1 pc for chemically homogeneous
star clusters, suggesting that any clusters identified as homogeneous in
chemical space must have formed within {\tilde}1 pc of one another.
However, in order to distinguish different star clusters in chemical
space, observations across multiple elements are required, and the
elements that are likely to be most efficient at separating distinct
clusters in chemical space are those whose correlation length in the
interstellar medium is of the order of tens of pc, comparable to the
sizes of individual molecular clouds.},

	Abstract = {{Context. A number of large spectroscopic surveys of stars in the Milky
Way are under way or are being planned. In this context it is important
to discuss the extent to which elemental abundances can be used as
discriminators between different (known and unknown) stellar populations
in the Milky Way. <BR /> Aims: We aim to establish the requirements in
terms of precision in elemental abundances, as derived from
spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way's stellar populations, in order
to detect interesting substructures in elemental abundance space. <BR />
Methods: We used Monte Carlo simulations to examine under which
conditions substructures in elemental abundance space can realistically
be detected. <BR /> Results: We present a simple relation between the
minimum number of stars needed to detect a given substructure and the
precision of the measurements. The results are in agreement with recent
small- and large-scale studies, with high and low precision,
respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: Large-number statistics cannot fully
compensate for low precision in the abundance measurements. Each survey
should carefully evaluate what the main science drivers are for the
survey and ensure that the chosen observational strategy will result in
the precision necessary to answer the questions posed.

	Abstract = {{Precise stellar ages from asteroseismology have become available and can
help setting stronger constraints on the evolution of the Galactic disc
components. Recently, asteroseismology has confirmed a clear age
difference in the solar annulus between two distinct sequences in the
[$\alpha$/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance ratios relation: the high-$\alpha$
and low-$\alpha$ stellar populations. We aim at reproducing these new
data with chemical evolution models including different assumptions for
the history and number of accretion events. We tested two different
approaches: a revised version of the `two-infall' model where the
high-$\alpha$ phase forms by a fast gas accretion episode and the
low-$\alpha$ sequence follows later from a slower gas infall rate, and
the parallel formation scenario where the two disc sequences form
coevally and independently. The revised `two-infall' model including
uncertainties in age and metallicity is capable of reproducing: i) the
[$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance relation at different Galactic
epochs, ii) the age$-$metallicity relation and the time evolution
[$\alpha$/Fe]; iii) the age distribution of the high-$\alpha$ and
low-$\alpha$ stellar populations, iv) the metallicity distribution
function. The parallel approach is not capable of properly reproduce the
stellar age distribution, in particular at old ages. In conclusion, the
best chemical evolution model is the revised `two-infall' one, where a
consistent delay of $\sim$4.3 Gyr in the beginning of the second gas
accretion episode is a crucial assumption to reproduce stellar
abundances and ages.

{\plusmn} 30 K, log g = 1.66 {\plusmn} 0.05, and [Fe/H] = -0.52 {\plusmn}
0.04. The effective temperature was determined using model atmosphere
fits to the observed spectral energy distribution from the blue to the
mid-infrared (0.44 to 10 {$\mu$}m). The surface gravity was calculated
using the trigonometric parallax of the star and stellar evolution
models. A differential abundance analysis relative to the solar spectrum
allowed us to derive iron abundances from equivalent width measurements
of 37 Fe I and 9 Fe II lines, unblended in the spectra of both Arcturus
and the Sun; the [Fe/H] value adopted is derived from Fe I lines. We
also determine the mass, radius, and age of Arcturus: M = 1.08 {\plusmn}
0.06 M $_{&sun;}$, R = 25.4 {\plusmn} 0.2 R $_{&sun;}$, and
{$\tau$} = 7.1$^{+1.5}$ $_{- 1.2}$ Gyr. Finally, abundances of
the following elements are measured from an equivalent width analysis of
atomic features: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni,

a local thick-disk star, consistent with its kinematics.

[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$]$\lt$ -0.9) observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These two stellar populations show the
most significant differences in their [X/Fe] ratios for the

having differing chemistry, the low metallicity high-Mg population
(which we denote {\ldquo}the HMg population{\rdquo}) exhibits a
significant net Galactic rotation, whereas the low-Mg population (or
{\ldquo}the LMg population{\rdquo}) has halo-like kinematics with little
to no net rotation. Based on its properties, the origin of the LMg
population is likely an accreted population of stars. The HMg population
shows chemistry (and to an extent kinematics) similar to the thick disk,
and is likely associated with in situ formation. The distinction between
the LMg and HMg populations mimics the differences between the
populations of low- and high-{$\alpha$} halo stars found in previous
studies, suggesting that these are samples of the same two populations.

A/F/G/K-type giant stars with $|z|\gt$ 5 kpc selected from the LAMOST
spectroscopic survey. The metallicity distribution of giant stars with 5
$\lt|z|\leqslant$ 15 kpc can be described by a three-peak Gaussian
model with peaks at [Fe/H] $\sim-0.6\pm0.1$, $-1.2\pm0.3$ and
$-2.0\pm0.2$, corresponding to the ratio of 19$\\%$, 74$\\%$ and 7$\\%$,
respectively. The $\rm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ is used to associate the three
peaks with the thick disk, inner-halo and outer-halo components of the
Galaxy. The metallicity distribution of these giant stars, which is fit
with Gaussians corresponding to the three components, show a growing
fraction of inner-halo component and declining fraction of the
thick-disk component with increasing distance from the Galactic plane.
Adopting a galaxy potential model, we also derive the orbital parameters
of the sample stars, such as orbit eccentricity and rotation velocity.
The peak values of derived orbital eccentricity for stars covering
different metallicity regions maintain $e\sim$ 0.75, independent of
height above the plane, within the range 5$\lt|z|\lt$ 15 kpc. By
comparing the MDFs of stars in different rotation velocity intervals, we
find that the majority of the retrograde stars are more metal-poor than
the prograde stars.

radial velocities provided by the fourteenth APOGEE data release (DR14)

prograde rotation, as well as orbits that are more bound and closer to
the plane, whereas the low-[Mg/Fe] population has $\ltV\gt$ closer to

from the centre and the Galactic plane. The intermediate-Mg stars
exhibit different orbital characteristics, moving with a strong prograde

an initial set of stellar parameters. The most promising candidate,
<ASTROBJ>2MASS J18082002-5104378</ASTROBJ> (V = 11.9), was observed at
high resolution (R = 50 000) with UVES at the VLT, and a standard
abundance analysis was performed. <BR /> Results: We found that
<ASTROBJ>2MASS J18082002-5104378</ASTROBJ> is an ultra metal-poor star
with stellar parameters T$_{eff}$ = 5440 K, log g = 3.0 dex,
v$_{t}$ = 1.5 km s$^{-1}$, [Fe/H] = -4.1 dex. The star has
[C/Fe] $\lt$ +0.9 in a 1D analysis, or [C/Fe] {\lsim} +0.5 if 3D effects
are considered; its abundance pattern is typical of normal (non-CEMP)
ultra metal-poor stars. Interestingly, the star has a binary companion.
<BR /> Conclusions: <ASTROBJ>2MASS J1808-5104</ASTROBJ> is the brightest
(V = 11.9) metal-poor star of its category, and it could be studied
further with even higher S/N spectroscopy to determine additional
chemical abundances, thus providing important constraints to the early
chemical evolution of our Galaxy.

(ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT, observing program 293.D-5036) and New
Technology Telescope (NTT, observing programs 091.D-0292 and

	Abstract = {{Sparse open clusters can be found at high galactic latitudes where
loosely populated clusters are more easily detected against the lower
stellar background. Because most star formation takes place in the thin
disk, the observed population of clusters far from the Galactic plane is
hard to explain. We combined spectral parameters from the GALAH survey
with the Gaia DR2 catalogue to study the dynamics and chemistry of five
old sparse high-latitude clusters in more detail. We find that four of
them (NGC 1252, NGC 6994, NGC 7772, NGC 7826) - originally classified in
1888 - are not clusters but are instead chance projections on the sky.
Member stars quoted in the literature for these four clusters are
unrelated in our multi-dimensional physical parameter space; the
published cluster properties are therefore irrelevant. We confirm the
existence of morphologically similar NGC 1901 for which we provide a
probabilistic membership analysis. An overdensity in three spatial
dimensions proves to be enough to reliably detect sparse clusters, but
the whole 6-dimensional space must be used to identify members with high
confidence, as demonstrated in the case of NGC 1901.

	Abstract = {{We present the metallicity results from the ARGOS spectroscopic survey
of the Galactic bulge. Our aim is to understand the formation of the
Galactic bulge: did it form via mergers, as expected from {$\Lambda$} cold
dark matter theory, or from disc instabilities, as suggested by its
boxy/peanut shape, or both? Our stars are mostly red clump giants, which
have a well-defined absolute magnitude from which distances can be
determined. We have obtained spectra for 28 000 stars at a spectral
resolution of R = 11 000. From these spectra, we have determined stellar
parameters and distances to an accuracy of $\lt$1.5 kpc. The stars in the
inner Galaxy span a large range in [Fe/H], -2.8 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le} +0.6.
From the spatial distribution of the red clump stars as a function of
[Fe/H], we propose that the stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.5 are part of the
boxy/peanut bar/bulge. We associate the lower metallicity stars ([Fe/H]
$\lt$ -0.5) with the thick disc, which may be puffed up in the inner
region, and with the inner regions of the metal-weak thick disc and
inner halo. For the bulge stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.5, we find two
discrete populations: (i) stars with [Fe/H] {\ap} -0.25 which provide a
roughly constant fraction of the stars in the latitude interval b =
-5{\deg} to -10{\deg}, and (ii) a kinematically colder, more metal-rich
population with mean [Fe/H] {\ap} +0.15 which is more prominent closer to
the plane. The changing ratio of these components with latitude appears
as a vertical abundance gradient of the bulge. We attribute both of
these bulge components to instability-driven bar/bulge formation from
the thin disc. We associate the thicker component with the stars of the
early less metal-rich thin disc, and associate the more metal-rich
population concentrated to the plane with the colder more metal-rich
stars of the early thin disc, similar to the colder and younger more
metal-rich stars seen in the thin disc in the solar neighbourhood today.
We do not exclude a weak underlying classical merger-generated bulge
component, but see no obvious kinematic association of any of our bulge
stars with such a classical bulge component. The clear spatial and
kinematic separation of the two bulge populations (i) and (ii) makes it
unlikely that any significant merger event could have affected the inner
regions of the Galaxy since the time when the bulge-forming
instabilities occurred.

We construct analytic models of the winding spiral structure, and
compare the resulting distribution of orbits with the observed

neighbourhood and with the distribution of rotational velocities over 8
kpc along the Sun-Galactic-centre-Galactic anti-centre line. We show
that the ridges in these observations are well reproduced by the winding

color-based selection reliably separates dwarfs from giants. The
selection is conservative in the sense that contamination is small but
not all giants are included (the selection primarily identifies K
giants). The color-based selection can be applied to stars brighter than
$W1\approx16$, more than two magnitudes fainter than techniques relying
on shallower 2MASS photometry. Many streams and clouds are visible in
the resulting sky maps, especially when binned by Gaia DR2 proper
motions, including the Sagittarius stream, the Hercules-Aquila Cloud,
the Eastern Banded Structure, Monoceros, and the Virgo Overdensity. In
addition to the characterization of new and known stellar streams, we

	Abstract = {{We use the first Gaia data release, combined with the RAVE and APOGEE
spectroscopic surveys, to investigate the origin of halo stars within
{\lsim} 3 kpc from the Sun. We identify halo stars kinematically as
moving at a relative speed of at least 220 km s$^{-1}$ with
respect to the local standard of rest. These stars are generally less
metal-rich than the disk, but surprisingly, half of our halo sample is
comprised of stars with [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$]$\gt$ -1. The orbital directions of
these metal-rich halo stars are preferentially aligned with the disk
rotation, in sharp contrast with the intrinsically isotropic orbital
distribution of the metal-poor halo stars. We find similar properties in
the Latte cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy
from the FIRE project. In Latte, metal-rich halo stars formed primarily
inside of the solar circle, whereas lower-metallicity halo stars
preferentially formed at larger distances (extending beyond the virial
radius). This suggests that metal-rich halo stars in the solar
neighborhood actually formed in situ within the Galactic disk, rather
than having been accreted from satellite systems. These stars, currently
on halo-like orbits, therefore have likely undergone substantial radial
migration/heating.

revealed that the Milky Way{\rsquo}s (MW) metallicity distribution
function (MDF) changes shape as a function of radius, transitioning from
being negatively skewed at small Galactocentric radii to positively
skewed at large Galactocentric radii. Using a high-resolution,
N-body+SPH simulation, we show that the changing skewness arises from
radial migration{\mdash}metal-rich stars form in the inner disk and
subsequently migrate to the metal-poorer outer disk. These migrated
stars represent a large fraction ($\backslash$gt 50\%) of the stars in the outer
disk; they populate the high-metallicity tail of the MDFs and are, in
general, more metal-rich than the surrounding outer disk gas. The
simulation also reproduces another surprising APOGEE result: the
spatially invariant high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] MDFs. This arises in the
simulation from the migration of a population formed within a narrow
range of radii (3.2 {\plusmn}1.2 kpc) and time (8.8 {\plusmn} 0.6 Gyr

homogeneous medium at early times. These results point toward the

made, but were limited by the precision and systematics that may be
present in the external catalogues used. Results. In addition to the
photometric quality assessment, we present the best estimates of the
three photometric passbands. Various colour-colour transformations are
also derived to enable the users to convert between the Gaia and
commonly used passbands. Conclusions. The internal analysis of the data
shows that the photometric calibrations can reach a precision as low as

	Abstract = {{The second Gaia data release (Gaia-DR2) contains, beyond the astrometry,
three-band photometry for 1.38 billion sources. We have used these three
broad bands to infer stellar effective temperatures, Teff, for all
sources brighter than G=17 mag with Teff in the range 3000-10 000 K (161
million sources). Using in addition the parallaxes, we infer the
line-of-sight extinction, A\_G, and the reddening, E[BP-RP], for 88
million sources. Together with a bolometric correction we derive
luminosity and radius for 77 million sources. These quantities as well
as their estimated uncertainties are part of Gaia-DR2. Here we describe
the procedures by which these quantities were obtained, including the
underlying assumptions, comparison with literature estimates, and the
limitations of our results. Typical accuracies are of order 324 K
(Teff), 0.46 mag (A\_G), 0.23 mag (E[BP-RP]), 15\% (luminosity), and 10\%
(radius). Being based on only a small number of observable quantities
and limited training data, our results are necessarily subject to some
extreme assumptions that can lead to strong systematics in some cases
(not included in the aforementioned accuracy estimates). One aspect is
the non-negativity contraint of our estimates, in particular extinction.
Yet in several regions of parameter space our results show very good
performance, for example for red clump stars and solar analogues. Large
uncertainties render the extinctions less useful at the individual star
level, but they show good performance for ensemble estimates. We
identify regimes in which our parameters should and should not be used
and we define a ``clean'' sample. Despite the limitations, this is the
largest catalogue of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. More
precise and detailed astrophysical parameters based on the full BP/RP
spectrophotometry are planned as part of the third Gaia data release.

in operation since 2014 July. This paper describes the second data
release from this phase, and the 14th from SDSS overall (making this
Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes the data taken by
SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (2014{\ndash}2016 July)
public. Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including
the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS
since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first
public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey; the first data from the second phase of the Apache
Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2),
including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data-driven
machine-learning algorithm known as {\ldquo}The Cannon{\rdquo} and almost
twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA)
survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper
describes the location and format of the publicly available data from
the SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical
papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and
observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS web site
(<A href=``http://www.sdss.org''>www.sdss.org</A>) has been updated for
this release and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials
and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect
astronomical data until 2020 and will be followed by SDSS-V.

	Abstract = {{We present a study using the second data release of the GALAH survey of
stellar parameters and elemental abundances of 15 pairs of stars
identified by Oh et al 2017. They identified these pairs as potentially
co-moving pairs using proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia DR1. We
find that 11 very wide ($\gt$1.7 pc) pairs of stars do in fact have
similar Galactic orbits, while a further four claimed co-moving pairs
are not truly co-orbiting. Eight of the 11 co-orbiting pairs have
reliable stellar parameters and abundances, and we find that three of
those are quite similar in their abundance patterns, while five have
significant [Fe/H] differences. For the latter, this indicates that they
could be co-orbiting because of the general dynamical coldness of the
thin disc, or perhaps resonances induced by the Galaxy, rather than a
shared formation site. Stars such as these, wide binaries, debris of
past star formation episodes, and coincidental co-orbiters, are crucial
for exploring the limits of chemical tagging in the Milky Way.

the Magellanic Clouds by the spectroscopic GALAH and TESS-HERMES
surveys: 434 stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 137 in the Small

structured star formation in the Magellanic Bridge. Both of these
surveys are aimed at the local volume of the Galaxy but have simple,
magnitude-limited selection functions that mean they include some
observations of luminous extra-Galactic stars. The surveys determine
stellar parameter and abundances using The Cannon, a data-driven
generative modelling approach. In this work, we explore the results from
The Cannon when it is fed the spectra of these intrinsically luminous
supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds, which are well outside the normal
bounds of The Cannon's training set. We find that, although the
parameters are astrophysically incorrect, the $v\sin i$ and the
abundances of lithium, barium, and magnesium are excellent discriminants
of these stars. It shows that in the future, with an expanded training
set, it should be possible to determine accurate values for these types
of stars.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: To understand the formation and evolution of the different
stellar populations within our Galaxy it is essential to combine
detailed kinematical and chemical information for large samples of
stars. The aim of this work is to explore the chemical abundances of
neutron capture elements which are a product of different
nucleosynthesis processes taking place in diverse objects in the Galaxy,
such as massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and
supernovae (SNe) explosions. <BR /> Methods: We derive chemical
abundances of Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Eu for a large sample
of more than 1000 FGK dwarf stars with high-resolution (R   115 000) and
high-quality spectra from the HARPS-GTO program. The abundances are
derived by a standard local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis
using measured equivalent widths (EWs) injected to the code MOOG and a
grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres. <BR /> Results: We find that thick
disc stars are chemically disjunct for Zn and Eu and also show on
average higher Zr but lower Ba and Y than the thin disc stars. We also
discovered that the previously identified high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich
population is also enhanced in Cu, Zn, Nd, and Eu with respect to the
thin disc but presents lower Ba and Y abundances on average, following
the trend of thick disc stars towards higher metallities and further
supporting the different chemical composition of this population. By
making a qualitative comparison of O (pure {$\alpha$}), Mg, Eu (pure
r-process), and s-process elements we can distinguish between the
contribution of the more massive stars (SNe II for {$\alpha$} and r-process
elements) and the lower mass stars (AGBs) whose contribution to the
enrichment of the Galaxy is delayed, due to their longer lifetimes. The
ratio of heavy-s to light-s elements of thin disc stars presents the
expected behaviour (increasing towards lower metallicities) and can be
explained by a major contribution of low-mass AGB stars for s-process
production at disc metallicities. However, the opposite trend found for
thick disc stars suggests that intermediate-mass AGB stars play an
important role in the enrichment of the gas from where these stars
formed. Previous works in the literature also point to a possible
primary production of light-s elements at low metallicities to explain
this trend. Finally, we also find an enhancement of light-s elements in
the thin disc at super-solar metallicities which could be caused by the
contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. <BR /> Conclusions: This work
proves the utility of homogeneous and high-quality data of modest sample
sizes. We find some interesting trends that might help to differentiate
thin and thick disc population (such as [Zn/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] ratios) and
that can also provide useful constraints for Galactic chemical evolution
models of the different populations in the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{Using data from the GALAH pilot survey, we determine properties of the
Galactic thin and thick discs near the solar neighbourhood. The data
cover a small range of Galactocentric radius (7.9 {\lsim} R\_GC {\lsim} 9.5
kpc), but extend up to 4 kpc in height from the Galactic plane, and
several kpc in the direction of Galactic anti-rotation (at longitude
260{\deg} {\le} {\ell} {\le} 280{\deg}). This allows us to reliably measure
the vertical density and abundance profiles of the chemically and
kinematically defined `thick' and `thin' discs of the Galaxy. The thin
disc (low-{$\alpha$} population) exhibits a steep negative vertical
metallicity gradient, at d[M/H]/dz = -0.18 {\plusmn} 0.01 dex
kpc$^{-1}$, which is broadly consistent with previous studies. In
contrast, its vertical {$\alpha$}-abundance profile is almost flat, with a
gradient of d[{$\alpha$}/M]/dz = 0.008 {\plusmn} 0.002 dex kpc$^{-1}$.
The steep vertical metallicity gradient of the low-{$\alpha$} population is
in agreement with models where radial migration has a major role in the
evolution of the thin disc. The thick disc (high-{$\alpha$} population) has
a weaker vertical metallicity gradient d[M/H]/dz = -0.058 {\plusmn} 0.003
dex kpc$^{-1}$. The {$\alpha$}-abundance of the thick disc is nearly
constant with height, d[{$\alpha$}/M]/dz = 0.007 {\plusmn} 0.002 dex
kpc$^{-1}$. The negative gradient in metallicity and the small
gradient in [{$\alpha$}/M] indicate that the high-{$\alpha$} population
experienced a settling phase, but also formed prior to the onset of
major Type Ia supernova enrichment. We explore the implications of the
distinct {$\alpha$}-enrichments and narrow [{$\alpha$}/M] range of the
sub-populations in the context of thick disc formation.

	Abstract = {{We investigate interstellar extinction curve variations towards {\tilde}4
deg$^{2}$ of the inner Milky Way in VIJK$_{s}$ photometry
from the OGLE-III (third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment) and VVV (VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea) surveys, with
supporting evidence from diffuse interstellar bands and F435W, F625W
photometry. We obtain independent measurements towards {\tilde}2000
sightlines of A$_{I}$, E(V - I), E(I - J) and E(J -
K$_{s}$), with median precision and accuracy of 2 per cent. We
find that the variations in the extinction ratios A$_{I}$/E(V -
I), E(I - J)/E(V - I) and E(J - K$_{s}$)/E(V - I) are large
(exceeding 20 per cent), significant and positively correlated, as
expected. However, both the mean values and the trends in these
extinction ratios are drastically shifted from the predictions of
Cardelli and Fitzpatrick, regardless of how R$_{V}$ is varied.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that variations in the shape of the
extinction curve have at least two degrees of freedom, and not one (e.g.
R$_{V}$), which we confirm with a principal component analysis. We
derive a median value of $\lt$A$_{V}$/A$_{Ks}$$\gt$ = 13.44,
which is {\tilde}60 per cent higher than the `standard' value. We show
that the Wesenheit magnitude W$_{I}$ = I - 1.61(I - J) is
relatively impervious to extinction curve variations. Given that these
extinction curves are linchpins of observational cosmology, and that it
is generally assumed that R$_{V}$ variations correctly capture
variations in the extinction curve, we argue that systematic errors in
the distance ladder from studies of Type Ia supernovae and Cepheids may
have been underestimated. Moreover, the reddening maps from the Planck
experiment are shown to systematically overestimate dust extinction by
{\tilde}100 per cent and lack sensitivity to extinction curve variations.

	Abstract = {{Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) can trace different conditions of the
interstellar medium (ISM) along the sightline toward the observed stars.
A small survey was made in optical wavelengths, producing
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra. We present
measurements of 19 DIBs' properties in 50 sightlines toward hot stars,
distributed at a variety of galactic coordinates and interstellar
reddening. Equivalent widths were obtained by fitting asymmetric
Gaussian and variable continua to DIBs. Conditions of the ISM were
calculated from eight atomic and molecular interstellar lines. Two
distinctly different types of DIBs were identified by carefully
comparing correlation coefficients between DIBs and reddening and by
different behavior in UV-shielded ({$\zeta$}) and nonshielded ({$\sigma$})
sightlines. A ratio of DIBs at 5780 {\AA} and 5797 {\AA} proved to
be reliable enough to distinguish between two different sightline types.
Based on the linear relations between DIB equivalent width and reddening
for {$\sigma$} and {$\zeta$} sightlines, we divide DIBs into type I (where
both linear relations are similar) and type II (where they are
significantly different). The linear relation for {$\zeta$} type sightlines
always shows a higher slope and larger x-intercept parameter than the
relation for {$\sigma$} sightlines. Scatter around the linear relation is
reduced after the separation, but it does not vanish completely. This
means that UV shielding is the dominant factor of the DIB equivalent
width versus reddening relation shape for {$\zeta$} sightlines, but in
{$\sigma$} sightlines other physical parameters play a major role. No
similar dependency on gas density, electron density, or turbulence was
observed. A catalog of all observed interstellar lines is made public.

	Abstract = {{Using standard 1D-LTE model atmosphere analysis, we provide an in-depth
investigation of iron abundance as derived from neutral and singly
ionization iron lines (Fe I, II) in nearby star clusters. Specifically,
we replicate the discrepancy regarding {$\Delta$}[Fe/H], wherein the
difference of Fe II-Fe I increases for stars of the same cluster with
decreasing T $_{eff}$, reaching an astonishing 1.0 dex at T
$_{eff}$ {\tilde} 4000 K. Previous studies have investigated this
anomaly in the Pleiades and Hyades clusters with no concrete solution.
In this analysis, we probe two samples: 63 wide binary field stars where
the primary star is of Sun-like temperatures and the secondary is a
K-dwarf, ranging from 4231 K {\le} T $_{eff}$ {\le} 6453 K, and 33
Hyades stars of temperatures 4268 K {\le} T $_{eff}$ {\le} 6072 K.
Previous studies have found discrepancies on the order of 1.0 dex.
However, we find that these studies have neglected line-blending effects
of certain Fe II lines, namely {$\lambda$} = $\{$4508.29 {\AA}, 4993.34
{\AA}, 5197.58 {\AA}, 5325.55 {\AA}, 5425.26 {\AA}, 6456.38

{$\Delta$}[Fe/H] decreases to {\tilde}0.6 dex in the field binaries and
{\tilde}0.3 dex in the Hyades. The reason for this remaining trend is
investigated by probing NLTE effects, as well as age and activity
considerations using Ca II H+K emission and Li absorption, but these
results appear to be small to negligible.

	Abstract = {{Deciphering the assembly history of the Milky Way is a formidable task,
which becomes possible only if one can produce high-resolution
chrono-chemo-kinematical maps of the Galaxy. Data from large-scale
astrometric and spectroscopic surveys will soon provide us with a
well-defined view of the current chemo-kinematical structure of the
Milky Way, but will only enable a blurred view on the temporal sequence
that led to the present-day Galaxy. As demonstrated by the (ongoing)
exploitation of data from the pioneering photometric missions CoRoT,
Kepler, and K2, asteroseismology provides the way forward: solar-like
oscillating giants are excellent evolutionary clocks thanks to the
availability of seismic constraints on their mass and to the tight
age-initial-mass relation they adhere to. In this paper we identify five
key outstanding questions relating to the formation and evolution of the
Milky Way that will need precise and accurate ages for large samples of
stars to be addressed, and we identify the requirements in terms of
number of targets and the precision on the stellar properties that are
needed to tackle such questions. By quantifying the asteroseismic yields
expected from PLATO for red-giant stars, we demonstrate that these
requirements are within the capabilities of the current instrument
design, provided that observations are sufficiently long to identify the
evolutionary state and allow robust and precise determination of
acoustic-mode frequencies. This will allow us to harvest data of
sufficient quality to reach a 10\% precision in age. This is a
fundamental pre-requisite to then reach the more ambitious goal of a
similar level of accuracy, which will only be possible if we have to
hand a careful appraisal of systematic uncertainties on age deriving
from our limited understanding of stellar physics, a goal which
conveniently falls within the main aims of PLATO's core science.

surveys including the $3\pi$ Steradian Survey and the Medium Deep Survey
in 5 bands ($\backslash$grizy). The mean 5$\sigma$ point source limiting
sensitivities in the stacked 3$\pi$ Steradian Survey in $\backslash$grizy are
(23.3, 23.2, 23.1, 22.3, 21.4) respectively. The upper bound on the
systematic uncertainty in the photometric calibration across the sky is
7-12 millimag depending on the bandpass. The systematic uncertainty of
the astrometric calibration using the Gaia frame comes from a comparison
of the results with Gaia: the standard deviation of the mean and median
residuals ($ \Delta ra, \Delta dec $ ) are (2.3, 1.7) milliarcsec, and
(3.1, 4.8) milliarcsec respectively. The Pan-STARRS system and the

@article{Schoenrich2017,
	Abstract = {{The early stages of a galaxy's evolution leave an imprint on its
metallicity distribution. We discuss the origins and evolution of radial
metallicity gradients in discs of spiral galaxies using an analytical
chemical evolution model. We explain how radial metallicity gradients in
stellar populations are determined by three factors: the radial
metallicity profile of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM),
radial changes in the star formation history (in particular, inside-out
formation) and radial mixing of stars. Under reasonable assumptions,
inside-out formation steepens the negative ISM metallicity gradient, but
contributes positively to the stellar metallicity gradient, up to
inverting the metallicity profile to a positive d[Fe/H]/dR. This
reconciles steep negative d[Fe/H]/dR in some high-redshift galaxies to
generally flatter gradients in local observations. We discuss the
evidence for inverse radial metallicity gradients (positive d[X/H]/dR)
at high redshifts and the inverse relationship between azimuthal
velocity and the metallicity (positive dV$_{varphi}$/d[Fe/H]) of
stars for the Milky Way's thick disc. The former can be achieved by high
central gas-loss rates and re-distribution processes, e.g. re-accretion
of enriched material in conjunction with the inside-out formation and
near-disc galactic fountaining. For the Milky Way-thick disc, we show
that the positive dV$_{varphi}$/d[Fe/H] correlation points to
comparable time-scales for inside-out formation, initial metal
enrichment and SNIa enrichment. We argue that the original ISM
metallicity gradient could be inferred with better data from the
high-metallicity tail of the alpha-enhanced population. Including
inside-out formation in our models changes the local vertical
metallicity gradient by about -0.2 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in line with
local measurements.

	Abstract = {{We employ measurements of the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratio derived from
low-resolution (R \~{} 2000) spectra of 17,277 G-type dwarfs from the SEGUE
survey to separate them into likely thin- and thick-disk subsamples.
Both subsamples exhibit strong gradients of orbital rotational velocity
with metallicity, of opposite signs, -20 to -30 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$ for the thin-disk and +40 to +50 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$ for the thick-disk population. The rotational velocity
is uncorrelated with Galactocentric distance for the thin-disk subsample
and exhibits a small trend for the thick-disk subsample. The rotational
velocity decreases with distance from the plane for both disk
components, with similar slopes (-9.0 {\plusmn} 1.0 km s$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-1}$). Thick-disk stars exhibit a strong trend of orbital
eccentricity with metallicity (about -0.2 dex$^{-1}$), while the
eccentricity does not change with metallicity for the thin-disk
subsample. The eccentricity is almost independent of Galactocentric
radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginal gradient of the
eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population. Both
subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity with
distance from the Galactic plane. The shapes of the eccentricity
distributions for the thin- and thick-disk populations are independent
of distance from the plane, and include no significant numbers of stars
with eccentricity above 0.6. Among several contemporary models of disk
evolution that we consider, radial migration appears to have played an
important role in the evolution of the thin-disk population, but
possibly less so for the thick disk, relative to the gas-rich merger or
disk heating scenarios. We emphasize that more physically realistic
models and simulations need to be constructed in order to carry out the
detailed quantitative comparisons that our new data enable.

	Abstract = {{We measure carbon and nitrogen abundances to a precision of {\lsim} 0.1
dex for 450,000 giant stars from their low-resolution (R{\tilde} 1800)
LAMOST DR2 survey spectra. We use these [$\{$$\{$C$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$] and [$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$]
measurements, together with empirical relations based on the APOKASC
sample, to infer stellar masses and implied ages for 230,000 of these
objects to 0.08 dex and 0.2 dex respectively. We use The Cannon, a
data-driven approach to spectral modeling, to construct a predictive
model for LAMOST spectra. Our reference set comprises 8125 stars
observed in common between the APOGEE and LAMOST surveys, taking seven
APOGEE DR12 labels (parameters) as ground truth: $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$,
$\{$log$\}$ g, [$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], [$\{$$\{$C$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], [$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$],
and $\{$A$\}$$_{{{k}$$\}$$\}$. We add seven colors to the Cannon model, based
on the g, r, I, J, H, K, W1, W2 magnitudes from APASS, 2MASS, and WISE,
which improves our constraints on $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$ and $\{$log$\}$ g by up
to 20\% and on $\{$A$\}$$_{{{k}$$\}$$\}$ by up to 70\%. Cross-validation of the
model demonstrates that, for high-$\{$$\{$S$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$ objects, our inferred
labels agree with the APOGEE values to within 50 K in temperature, 0.04
mag in $\{$A$\}$$_{{{k}$$\}$$\}$, and $\lt$ 0.1 dex in $\{$log$\}$ g, [$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$],
[$\{$$\{$C$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], [$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], and [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$]. We apply the model
to 450,000 giants in LAMOST DR2 that have not been observed by APOGEE.
This demonstrates that precise individual abundances can be measured
from low-resolution spectra and represents the largest catalog to date
of homogeneous stellar [$\{$$\{$C$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], [$\{$$\{$N$\}$$\}$/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], masses, and ages.
As a result, we greatly increase the number and sky coverage of stars
with mass and age estimates.

	Abstract = {{The spatial structure of stellar populations with different chemical
abundances in the Milky Way (MW) contains a wealth of information on
Galactic evolution over cosmic time. We use data on 14,699 red-clump
stars from the APOGEE survey, covering 4 $\{$kpc$\}${\lsim} R{\lsim} 15 $\{$kpc$\}$,
to determine the structure of mono-abundance populations
(MAPs){\mdash}stars in narrow bins in [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] and
[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$]{\mdash}accounting for the complex effects of the APOGEE
selection function and the spatially variable dust obscuration. We
determine that all MAPs with enhanced [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] are centrally
concentrated and are well-described as exponentials with a scale length
of 2.2+/- 0.2 $\{$kpc$\}$ over the whole radial range of the disk. We discover
that the surface-density profiles of low-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs are
complex: they do not monotonically decrease outwards, but rather display
a peak radius ranging from {\ap} 5 to {\ap} 13 $\{$kpc$\}$ at low [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$].
The extensive radial coverage of the data allows us to measure radial
trends in the thickness of each MAP. While high-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs
have constant scale heights, low-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs flare. We confirm,
now with high-precision abundances, previous results that each MAP
contains only a single vertical scale height and that low-[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$],
low-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] and high-[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], high-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$] MAPs
have intermediate ($\{$h$\}$$_{Z}${\ap} 300$\{$--$\}$600 $\{$pc$\}$) scale heights
that smoothly bridge the traditional thin- and thick-disk divide. That
the high-[{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$], thick disk components do not flare is strong
evidence against their thickness being caused by radial migration. The
correspondence between the radial structure and chemical-enrichment age
of stellar populations is clear confirmation of the inside-out growth of
galactic disks. The details of these relations will constrain the
variety of physical conditions under which stars form throughout the MW
disk.

	Abstract = {{Realistic ab-initio 3D, radiative-hydrodynamical convection simulations
of the solar granulation have been applied to Fe i and Fe ii line
formation. In contrast to classical analyses based on hydrostatic 1D
model atmospheres the procedure contains no adjustable free parameters
but the treatment of the numerical viscosity in the construction of the
3D, time-dependent, inhomogeneous model atmosphere and the elemental
abundance in the 3D spectral synthesis. However, the numerical viscosity
is introduced purely for numerical stability purposes and is determined
from standard hydrodynamical test cases with no adjustments allowed to
improve the agreement with the observational constraints from the solar
granulation. The non-thermal line broadening is mainly provided by the
Doppler shifts arising from the convective flows in the solar
photosphere and the solar oscillations. The almost perfect agreement
between the predicted temporally and spatially averaged line profiles
for weak Fe lines with the observed profiles and the absence of trends
in derived abundances with line strengths, seem to imply that the micro-
and macroturbulence concepts are obsolete in these 3D analyses.
Furthermore, the theoretical line asymmetries and shifts show a very
satisfactory agreement with observations with an accuracy of typically
50-100 m s$^{-1}$ on an absolute velocity scale. The remaining
minor discrepancies point to how the convection simulations can be
refined further.

	Abstract = {{Context. To derive space velocities of stars along the line of sight
from wavelength shifts in stellar spectra requires accounting for a
number of second-order effects. For most stars, gravitational redshifts,
convective blueshifts, and transverse stellar motion are the dominant
contributors. <BR /> Aims: We provide theoretical corrections for the
net velocity shifts due to convection expected for the measurements from
the Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). <BR /> Methods: We used a
set of three-dimensional time-dependent simulations of stellar surface
convection computed with CO5BOLD to calculate spectra of late-type stars
in the Gaia RVS range and to infer the net velocity offset that
convective motions will induce in radial velocities derived by
cross-correlation. <BR /> Results: The net velocity shifts derived by
cross-correlation depend both on the wavelength range and spectral
resolution of the observations. Convective shifts for Gaia RVS
observations are less than 0.1 km s$^{-1}$ for late-K-type stars,
and they increase with stellar mass, reaching about 0.3 km
s$^{-1}$ or more for early F-type dwarfs. This tendency is the
result of an increase with effective temperature in both temperature and
velocity fluctuations in the line-forming region. Our simulations also
indicate that the net RVS convective shifts can be positive (i.e.
redshifts) in some cases. Overall, the blueshifts weaken slightly with
increasing surface gravity, and are enhanced at low metallicity.
Gravitational redshifts amount to 0.7 km s$^{-1}$ and dominate
convective blueshifts for dwarfs, but become much weaker for giants.

	Abstract = {{4MOST is a wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic survey facility
under development for the VISTA telescope of the European Southern
Observatory (ESO). Its main science drivers are in the fields of
galactic archeology, high-energy physics, galaxy evolution and
cosmology. 4MOST will in particular provide the spectroscopic
complements to the large area surveys coming from space missions like
Gaia, eROSITA, Euclid, and PLATO and from ground-based facilities like
VISTA, VST, DES, LSST and SKA. The 4MOST baseline concept features a 2.5
degree diameter field-of-view with \~{}2400 fibres in the focal surface
that are configured by a fibre positioner based on the tilting spine
principle. The fibres feed two types of spectrographs; \~{}1600 fibres go
to two spectrographs with resolution R$\lt$5000 ({$\lambda$}\~{}390-930 nm) and
\~{}800 fibres to a spectrograph with R$\gt$18,000 ({$\lambda$}\~{}392-437 nm and
515-572 nm and 605-675 nm). Both types of spectrographs are
fixed-configuration, three-channel spectrographs. 4MOST will have an
unique operations concept in which 5 year public surveys from both the
consortium and the ESO community will be combined and observed in
parallel during each exposure, resulting in more than 25 million spectra
of targets spread over a large fraction of the southern sky. The 4MOST
Facility Simulator (4FS) was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of
this observing concept. 4MOST has been accepted for implementation by
ESO with operations expected to start by the end of 2020. This paper
provides a top-level overview of the 4MOST facility, while other papers
in these proceedings provide more detailed descriptions of the
instrument concept[1], the instrument requirements development[2], the
systems engineering implementation[3], the instrument model[4], the
fibre positioner concepts[5], the fibre feed[6], and the
spectrographs[7].

radial velocity measurements with the accuracies needed to produce a
stereoscopic and kinematic census of about one billion stars throughout
our Galaxy (and into the Local Group), amounting to about 1 percent of
the Galactic stellar population. GAIA's main scientific goal is to
clarify the origin and history of our Galaxy, from a quantitative census
of the stellar populations. It will advance questions such as when the
stars in our Galaxy formed, when and how it was assembled, and its
distribution of dark matter. The survey aims for completeness to V=20
mag, with accuracies of about 10 mu as at 15 mag. Combined with
astrophysical information for each star, provided by on-board
multi-colour photometry and (limited) spectroscopy, these data will have
the precision necessary to quantify the early formation, and subsequent
dynamical, chemical and star formation evolution of our Galaxy.
Additional products include detection and orbital classification of tens
of thousands of extra-Solar planetary systems, and a comprehensive
survey of some 10$^{5}$-10$^{6}$ minor bodies in our Solar
System, through galaxies in the nearby Universe, to some 500 000 distant
quasars. It will provide a number of stringent new tests of general
relativity and cosmology. The complete satellite system was evaluated as
part of a detailed technology study, including a detailed payload
design, corresponding accuracy assesments, and results from a prototype
data reduction development.

	Abstract = {{PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity
(2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass,
density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental
questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there
other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable
planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture
telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence)
providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg $^{2}$) and a large
photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag)
stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to
Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined
by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology
will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate
stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright
targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk
planet parameters: 2 \%, 4-10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and
ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two
long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets
reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an
additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky.
PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize
hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to
gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first
large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii,
masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial
planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures
are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers
of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0
catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet
diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean
density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet
formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and
scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how
planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such
as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study
planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will
further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to
identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and
in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass,
low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars
and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy
exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential
to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The
planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact
on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light
curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of
stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve
stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known
ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our
Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of
stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships.
Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO
2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic
science.

	Abstract = {{The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will search for planets
transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by NASA for
launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will
be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth.
During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical
charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence
dwarf stars with I$_{C}${\ap}4-13 for temporary drops in brightness
caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval
ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic
latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the
ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up
observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness
measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min,
and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be
10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler
mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with
follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand
planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in
size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months,
inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The
TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting
transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for
detailed investigations.

(APOGEE) survey operated from 2011-2014 using the APOGEE
spectrograph, which collects high-resolution (R {\tilde} 22,500), near-IR
(1.51-1.70 {$\mu$}m) spectra with a multiplexing (300 fiber-fed
objects) capability. We describe the survey data products that are
publicly available, which include catalogs with radial velocity, stellar
parameters, and 15 elemental abundances for over 150,000 stars, as well
as the more than 500,000 spectra from which these quantities are
derived. Calibration relations for the stellar parameters
($\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$ g, [M/H], [{$\alpha$}/M]) and abundances (C, N,
O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) are presented and
discussed. The internal scatter of the abundances within clusters
indicates that abundance precision is generally between 0.05 and 0.09
dex across a broad temperature range; it is smaller for some elemental
abundances within more limited ranges and at high signal-to-noise ratio.
We assess the accuracy of the abundances using comparison of mean
cluster metallicities with literature values, APOGEE observations of the
solar spectrum and of Arcturus, comparison of individual star abundances
with other measurements, and consideration of the locus of derived
parameters and abundances of the entire sample, and find that it is
challenging to determine the absolute abundance scale; external accuracy
may be good to 0.1-0.2 dex. Uncertainties may be larger at cooler
temperatures ($\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$  $\backslash$lt  4000 $\{$$\{$K$\}$$\}$). Access to the
public data release and data products is described, and some guidance
for using the data products is provided.

Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is a high-resolution near-infrared
spectroscopic survey covering all of the major components of the Galaxy,

from the first two years of APOGEE operations, selected based on their
position in color-metallicity-surface-gravity-effective-temperature
space using a new method calibrated using stellar evolution models and
high-quality asteroseismology data. The narrowness of the RC locus in
color-metallicity-luminosity space allows us to assign distances to the
stars with an accuracy of 5\%-10\%. The sample extends to typical
distances of about 3 kpc from the Sun, with some stars out to 8 kpc, and
spans a volume of approximately 100 kpc$^{3}$ over 5 kpc $\lt$\~{} R

matches to major proper motion catalogs. We determine the survey
selection function for this data set and discuss how the RC selection
samples the underlying stellar populations. We use this sample to limit
any azimuthal variations in the median metallicity within the
{\ap}45{\deg} azimuthal region covered by the current sample to be
$\lt$=0.02 dex, which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the
radial metallicity gradient. This result constrains coherent

	Abstract = {{The apparent size of stars is a crucial benchmark for fundamental
stellar properties such as effective temperatures, radii and surface
gravities. While interferometric measurements of stellar angular
diameters are the most direct method to gauge these, they are still
limited to relatively nearby and bright stars, which are saturated in
most of the modern photometric surveys. This dichotomy prevents us from
safely extending well-calibrated relations to the faint stars targeted
in large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. Here, we alleviate this
obstacle by presenting South African Astronomical Observatory
near-infrared JHK observations of 55 stars: 16 of them have
interferometric angular diameters and the rest are in common with the 2
Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS, unsaturated) data set, allowing us to tie
the effective temperatures and angular diameters derived via the
infrared flux method to the interferometric scale. We extend the test to
recent interferometric measurements of unsaturated 2MASS stars,
including giants, and the metal-poor benchmark target HD122563. With a
critical evaluation of the systematics involved, we conclude that a 1
per cent accuracy in fundamental stellar parameters is usually within
reach. Caution, however, must be used when indirectly testing a
T$_{eff}$ scale via colour relations as well as when assessing the
reliability of interferometric measurements, especially at
submilliarcsec level. As a result, rather different effective
temperature scales can be compatible with a given subset of
interferometric data. We highlight some caveats to be aware of in such a
quest and suggest a simple method to check against systematics in
fundamental measurements. A new diagnostic combination seismic radii
with astrometric distances is also presented.

cluster Gaia 1 using spectra acquired with the HERMES and AAOmega

identified 41 cluster members, and yielded an overall metallicity of
[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$H$\}$]=-0.13{\plusmn} 0.13 and barycentric radial velocity of

has a circular orbit with a radius of about 12 kpc, but with a large out
of plane motion: z\_$\{$max$\}$=1.1\^{}$\{$+0.4$\}$\_$\{$-0.3$\}$ kpc. Clusters with such

	Abstract = {{We present a large set of theoretical isochrones, whose distinctive
features mostly reside on the greatly-improved treatment of the
thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. Essentially,
we have coupled the TP-AGB tracks described in Paper I, at their stages
of pre-flash quiescent H-shell burning, with the evolutionary tracks for
the previous evolutionary phases from Girardi et al. (2000, A{\amp}AS,
141, 371). Theoretical isochrones for any intermediate value of age and
metallicity are then derived by interpolation in the grids. We take care
that the isochrones keep, to a good level of detail, the several
peculiarities present in these TP-AGB tracks - e.g., the cool tails of
C-type stars owing to the use of proper molecular opacities as
convective dredge-up occurs along the TP-AGB; the bell-shaped sequences
in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram for stars with hot-bottom
burning; the changes of pulsation mode between fundamental and first
overtone; the sudden changes of mean mass-loss rates as the surface
chemistry changes from M- to C-type; etc. Theoretical isochrones are
then converted to about 20 different photometric systems - including
traditional ground-based systems, and those of recent major wide-field
surveys such as SDSS, OGLE, DENIS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, etc., - by means of
synthetic photometry applied to an updated library of stellar spectra,
suitably extended to include C-type stars. Finally, we correct the
predicted photometry for the effect of circumstellar dust during the
mass-losing stages of the AGB evolution, which allows us to improve the
results for the optical-to-infrared systems, and to simulate mid- and
far-IR systems such as those of Spitzer and AKARI. We illustrate the
most striking properties of these isochrones by means of basic
comparisons with observational data for the Milky Way disc and the
Magellanic Clouds. Access to the data is provided both via a web
repository of static tables (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/dustyAGB07 and
CDS), and via an interactive web interface
(http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd), which provides tables for any
intermediate value of age and metallicity, for several photometric
systems, and for different choices of dust properties.

the radiative opacities by Huebner et al. (1977). All the stellar models
are followed from the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) to the central
carbon ignition for massive stars or to the beginning of the thermally

intermediate mass stars. For each isochrone, we give the current mass,
effective temperatures, bolometric and visual magnitudes, (U-B), (B-V),

function for the case of the Salpeter law. In addition to this,
integrated magnitudes and colors at several characteristic points are
also presented together with the mass of the remnant star when
appropriate. The main characteristic that makes this set of isochrones
very valuable is based on their extension in mass and chemical
composition, besides the calculation of late stages of evolution, beyond
the red giant tip till the white dwarf stage after the planetary nebula

	Abstract = {{We present here a fast code for creating a synthetic survey of the Milky
Way. Given one or more color-magnitude bounds, a survey size, and
geometry, the code returns a catalog of stars in accordance with a given
model of the Milky Way. The model can be specified by a set of density
distributions or as an N-body realization. We provide fast and efficient
algorithms for sampling both types of models. As compared to earlier
sampling schemes which generate stars at specified locations along a
line of sight, our scheme can generate a continuous and smooth
distribution of stars over any given volume. The code is quite general
and flexible and can accept input in the form of a star formation rate,
age-metallicity relation, age-velocity-dispersion relation, and analytic
density distribution functions. Theoretical isochrones are then used to
generate a catalog of stars, and support is available for a wide range
of photometric bands. As a concrete example, we implement the
Besan{\c c}on Milky Way model for the disk. For the stellar halo we
employ the simulated stellar halo N-body models of Bullock {\amp}
Johnston. In order to sample N-body models, we present a scheme that
disperses the stars spawned by an N-body particle, in such a way that
the phase-space density of the spawned stars is consistent with that of
the N-body particles. The code is ideally suited to generating synthetic
data sets that mimic near future wide area surveys such as GAIA, LSST,
and HERMES. As an application we study the prospect of identifying
structures in the stellar halo with a simulated GAIA survey. We plan to
make the code publicly available.

	Abstract = {{The fourth United States Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD Astrograph
Catalog, UCAC4, was released in 2012 August (double-sided DVD and CDS
data center Vizier catalog I/322). It is the final release in this
series and contains over 113 million objects; over 105 million of them
with proper motions (PMs). UCAC4 is an updated version of UCAC3 with
about the same number of stars also covering all-sky. Bugs were fixed,
Schmidt plate survey data were avoided, and precise five-band photometry
was added for about half the stars. Astrograph observations have been
supplemented for bright stars by FK6, Hipparcos, and Tycho-2 data to
compile a UCAC4 star catalog complete from the brightest stars to about
magnitude R = 16. Epoch 1998-2004 positions are obtained from
observations with the 20 cm aperture USNO Astrograph's ``red lens,''
equipped with a 4k by 4k CCD. Mean positions and PMs are derived by
combining these observations with over 140 ground- and space-based
catalogs, including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as
unpublished measures of over 5000 plates from other astrographs. For
most of the faint stars in the southern hemisphere, the first epoch
plates from the Southern Proper Motion program form the basis for PMs,
while the Northern Proper Motion first epoch plates serve the same
purpose for the rest of the sky. These data are supplemented by 2MASS
near-IR photometry for about 110 million stars and five-band (B, V, g,
r, i) APASS data for over 51 million stars. Thus the published UCAC4, as
were UCAC3 and UCAC2, is a compiled catalog with the UCAC observational
program being a major component. The positional accuracy of stars in
UCAC4 at mean epoch is about 15-100 mas per coordinate, depending on
magnitude, while the formal errors in PMs range from about 1 to 10 mas
yr$^{-1}$ depending on magnitude and observing history.
Systematic errors in PMs are estimated to be about 1-4 mas
yr$^{-1}$.

	Abstract = {{We provide AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey (APASS) photometry in the
Landolt BV and Sloan g'r'i' bands for all 425,743 stars included in the
fourth RAVE Data Release. The internal accuracy of the APASS photometry
of RAVE stars, expressed as the error of the mean of data obtained and
separately calibrated over a median of four distinct observing epochs
and distributed between 2009 and 2013, is 0.013, 0.012, 0.012, 0.014,
and 0.021 mag for the B, V, g', r', and i' bands, respectively. The
equally high external accuracy of APASS photometry has been verified on
secondary Landolt and Sloan photometric standard stars not involved in
the APASS calibration process and on a large body of literature data on
field and cluster stars, confirming the absence of offsets and trends.
Compared with the Carlsberg Meridian Catalog (CMC-15), APASS astrometry
of RAVE stars is accurate to a median value of 0.098 arcsec. Brightness
distribution functions for the RAVE stars have been derived in all
bands. APASS photometry of RAVE stars, augmented by 2MASS JHK infrared
data, has been {$\chi$}$^{2}$ fitted to a densely populated synthetic
photometric library designed to widely explore temperature, surface
gravity, metallicity, and reddening. Resulting T $_{eff}$ and E
$_{ B - V }$, computed over a range of options, are provided
and discussed, and will be kept updated in response to future APASS and
RAVE data releases. In the process, we find that the reddening caused by
a homogeneous slab of dust, extending for 140 pc on either side of the
Galactic plane and responsible for E$^{poles}$$_{B-V}$ =
0.036 {\plusmn} 0.002 at the Galactic poles, is a suitable approximation
of the actual reddening encountered at Galactic latitudes |b| $\gt$=

	Abstract = {{Members of widely-separated stellar binaries ($\gt$ 0.1 pc) or loosely
bound stellar associations and clusters are born with small spreads in
kinematics and chemistry, but disrupt and dissociate on timescales
comparable to their orbital time within the Milky Way. The kinematic
properties of comoving star pairs---bound wide binaries or unbound but
coeval stars---are therefore sensitive to both the smooth tidal field
and gravitational perturbation spectrum of the Milky Way. In previous
work, we identified $\gt$4,000 candidate comoving pairs using only
astrometric data from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) catalog
and find a large number of pairs with separations $\gt$ 1 pc. Without
radial velocity measurements for the vast majority of these pairs, the
false-positive rate at these separations is significant (\~{}50\%). Here we
present results from our own low-resolution radial-velocity survey of a
random sample of the candidate pairs to identify and validate true
comoving star pairs. Of the 311 observed comoving pairs, we confirm 127
comoving pairs with separations as large as \~{}10 pc, our original search
limit. Between separations of 0.001 pc to \~{}0.5 pc, the number of
confirmed pairs per separation decreases with increasing separation
(number per log separation is uniform). From \~{}0.5 pc to 10 pc, the
number per separation is approximately uniform (number per log
separation increases). We confirm the discovery of a population of
comoving star pairs at very large separations, suggesting that disrupted
wide binaries and stellar associations remain approximately spatially
coherent.

	Abstract = {{We develop a data-driven spectral model for identifying and
characterizing spatially unresolved multiple-star systems and apply it
to APOGEE DR13 spectra of main-sequence stars. Binaries and triples are
identified as targets whose spectra can be significantly better fit by a
superposition of two or three model spectra, drawn from the same
isochrone, than any single-star model. From an initial sample of
{\tilde}20 000 main-sequence targets, we identify {\tilde}2500 binaries in
which both the primary and secondary stars contribute detectably to the
spectrum, simultaneously fitting for the velocities and stellar
parameters of both components. We additionally identify and fit
{\tilde}200 triple systems, as well as {\tilde}700 velocity-variable
systems in which the secondary does not contribute detectably to the
spectrum. Our model simplifies the process of simultaneously fitting
single- or multi-epoch spectra with composite models and does not depend
on a velocity offset between the two components of a binary, making it
sensitive to traditionally undetectable systems with periods of hundreds
or thousands of years. In agreement with conventional expectations,
almost all the spectrally identified binaries with measured parallaxes
fall above the main sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram. We find
excellent agreement between spectrally and dynamically inferred mass
ratios for the {\tilde}600 binaries in which a dynamical mass ratio can
be measured from multi-epoch radial velocities. We obtain full orbital
solutions for 64 systems, including 14 close binaries within
hierarchical triples. We make available catalogues of stellar
parameters, abundances, mass ratios, and orbital parameters.

	Abstract = {{We introduce a new generation of PARSEC-COLIBRI stellar isochrones that
includes a detailed treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant
branch (TP-AGB) phase, covering a wide range of initial metallicities
(0.0001 $\lt$ Z$_{I}$ $\lt$ 0.06). Compared to previous releases,
the main novelties and improvements are use of new TP-AGB tracks and
related atmosphere models and spectra for M and C-type stars; inclusion
of the surface H+He+CNO abundances in the isochrone tables, accounting
for the effects of diffusion, dredge-up episodes and hot-bottom burning;
inclusion of complete thermal pulse cycles, with a complete description
of the in-cycle changes in the stellar parameters; new pulsation models
to describe the long-period variability in the fundamental and
first-overtone modes; and new dust models that follow the growth of the
grains during the AGB evolution, in combination with radiative transfer
calculations for the reprocessing of the photospheric emission. Overall,
these improvements are expected to lead to a more consistent and
detailed description of properties of TP-AGB stars expected in resolved
stellar populations, especially in regard to their mean photometric
properties from optical to mid-infrared wavelengths. We illustrate the
expected numbers of TP-AGB stars of different types in stellar
populations covering a wide range of ages and initial metallicities,
providing further details on the {\ldquo}C-star island{\rdquo} that
appears at intermediate values of age and metallicity, and about the
AGB-boosting effect that occurs at ages close to 1.6-Gyr for populations
of all metallicities. The isochrones are available through a new
dedicated web server.

	Abstract = {{High-precision spectroscopy of large stellar samples plays a crucial
role for several topical issues in astrophysics. Examples include
studying the chemical structure and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy,
tracing the origin of chemical elements, and characterizing planetary
host stars. Data are accumulating from instruments that obtain
high-quality spectra of stars in the ultraviolet, optical and infrared
wavelength regions on a routine basis. These instruments are located at
ground-based 2-10 m class telescopes around the world, in addition
to the spectrographs with unique capabilities available at the Hubble
Space Telescope. The interpretation of these spectra requires
high-quality transition data for numerous species, in particular neutral
and singly ionized atoms, and di- or triatomic molecules. We rely
heavily on the continuous efforts of laboratory astrophysics groups that
produce and improve the relevant experimental and theoretical atomic and
molecular data. The compilation of the best available data is
facilitated by databases and electronic infrastructures such as the NIST
Atomic Spectra Database, the VALD database, or the Virtual Atomic and
Molecular Data Centre. We illustrate the current status of atomic data
for optical stellar spectra with the example of the Gaia-ESO Public
Spectroscopic Survey. Data sources for 35 chemical elements were
reviewed in an effort to construct a line list for a homogeneous
abundance analysis of up to 10$^{5}$ stars.

	Abstract = {{We present a Bayesian implementation of isochrone fitting in deriving
stellar ages and masses, incorporating absolute K magnitude (M\_K)
derived from 2MASS photometry and Gaia DR1 parallax and differentiation
between initial bulk metallicity and present day surface metallicity,
with allowance for incorporating further constraints (e.g.,
asteroseismology) when available. As a test, we re-computed stellar ages
and masses of {\tilde}4000 stars in the solar neighbourhood from six
well-studied literature samples using both Hipparcos and TGAS
parallaxes. Our ages are found to be compatible with literature values
but with reduced uncertainties in general. The inclusion of
parallax-based M\_K serves as an additional constraint on the derived
quantities, especially when systematic errors in stellar parameters are
underestimated. We reconstructed the age-metallicity relationship in the
solar neighbourhood by re-analysing the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey with
the inclusion of TGAS-parallaxes and initial bulk metallicity sampling.
We found a flat trend for disk stars with ages $\lt$11 Gyr but with
smaller scatter at all ages compared to literature.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: Previous studies have found that the Galactic rotation
velocity-metallicity (V-[Fe/H]) relations for the thin and thick disk
populations show negative and positive slopes, respectively. The first
Gaia data release includes the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)
information, which we use to analyze the V-[Fe/H] relation for a
strictly selected sample with high enough astrometric accuracy. We aim
to present an explanation for the slopes of the V-[Fe/H] relationship.
<BR /> Methods: We have identified a sample of stars with accurate Gaia
TGAS data and SDSS APOGEE [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements. We
measured the V-[Fe/H] relation for thin and thick disk stars classified
on the basis of their [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundances. <BR />
Results: We find dV/ d [Fe/H] = -18 {\plusmn} 2 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$ for stars in the thin disk and dV/ d [Fe/H] = +23
{\plusmn} 10 km s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$ for thick disk stars, and
thus we confirm the different signs for the slopes. The negative value
of dV/d[Fe/H] for thin disk stars is consistent with previous work, but
the combination of TGAS and APOGEE data provides higher precision, even
though systematic errors could exceed {\plusmn}5 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$. Our average measurement of dV/d[Fe/H] for local thick
disk stars shows a somewhat flatter slope than in previous studies, but
we confirm a significant spread and a dependence of the slope on the
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratio of the stars. Using a simple N-body model, we
demonstrate that the observed trends for the thick and thin disk can be
explained by the measured radial metallicity gradients and the
correlation between orbital eccentricity and metallicity in the thick
disk. <BR /> Conclusions: We conclude that the V-[Fe/H] relation for
thin disk stars is well determined from our TGAS-APOGEE sample, and a
direct consequence of the radial metallicity gradient and the
correlation between Galactic rotation and mean Galactocentric distance.
Stars formed farther away from the solar circle tend to be near their
orbital pericenter, showing larger velocities and on average lower
metallicities, while those closer to the Galactic center are usually
closer to their orbital apocenter, therefore moving slower and with
higher metallicities. The positive dV/d[Fe/H] for the thick disk sample
is likely connected to the correlation between orbital eccentricity and
metallicity for that population.

	Abstract = {{Context. The velocity distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood
is inhomogeneous and rich with stellar streams and kinematic structures.
These may retain important clues regarding the formation and dynamical
history of the Milky Way. However, the nature and origin of many of the
streams and structures is unclear, hindering our understanding of how
the Milky Way formed and evolved. <BR /> Aims: We aim to study the
velocity distribution of stars of the solar neighbourhood and
investigate the properties of individual kinematic structures in order
to improve our understanding of their origins. <BR /> Methods: Using the
astrometric data provided by Gaia DR1/TGAS and radial velocities from
RAVE DR5 we perform a wavelet analysis with the {\`a} trous algorithm
of 55 831 stars that have U and V velocity uncertainties less than 4 km
s$^{-1}$. An auto-convolution histogram method is used to filter
the output data, and we then run Monte Carlo simulations to verify that
the detected structures are real and are not caused by noise due to
velocity uncertainties. Additionally we analysed our stellar sample by
splitting all stars into a nearby sample ($\lt$300 pc) and a distant
sample ($\gt$300 pc), and two chemically defined samples that to a first
degree represent the thin and the thick disks. <BR /> Results: We detect
19 kinematic structures in the solar neighbourhood in the range of
scales 3-16 km s$^{-1}$ at the 3{$\sigma$} confidence level. Among
them we identified well-known groups (such as Hercules, Sirius, Coma
Berenices, Pleiades, and Wolf 630), confirmed recently detected groups
(such as Antoja12 and Bobylev16), and detected a new structure at (U,V)
{\ap} (37,8) km s$^{-1}$. Another three new groups are tentatively
detected, but require further confirmation. Some of the detected groups
show clear dependence on distance in the sense that they are only
present in the nearby sample ($\lt$300 pc), and others appear to be
correlated with chemistry as they are only present in one of the
chemically defined thin and thick disk samples. <BR /> Conclusions: With
the much enlarged stellar sample and much increased precision in
distances and proper motions, provided by Gaia DR1/TGAS we have shown
that the velocity distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood
contains more structures than previously known. A new feature is
discovered and three recently detected groups are confirmed at high
confidence level. Dividing the sample based on distance and/or
metallicity shows that there are variety of structures which form
large-scale and small-scale groups; some of them have clear trends on
metallicities, others are a mixture of both disk stars. Based on these
findings we discuss possible origins of each group.

@article{Mikolaitis2017,
	Abstract = {{Context. The pattern of chemical abundance ratios in stellar populations
of the Milky Way is a fingerprint of the Galactic chemical history. In
order to interpret such chemical fossils of Galactic archaeology,
chemical evolution models have to be developed. However, despite the
complex physics included in the most recent models, significant
discrepancies between models and observations are widely encountered.
<BR /> Aims: The aim of this paper is to characterise the abundance
patterns of five iron-peak elements (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for which
the stellar origin and chemical evolution are still debated. <BR />
Methods: We automatically derived iron peak (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and
{$\alpha$} element (Mg) chemical abundances for 4666 stars, adopting
classical LTE spectral synthesis and 1D atmospheric models. Our
observational data collection is composed of high-resolution, high
signal-to-noise ratios HARPS and FEROS spectra, which were previously
parametrised by the AMBRE project. <BR /> Results: We used the bimodal
distribution of the magnesium-to-iron abundance ratios to chemically
classify our sample stars into different Galactic substructures: thin
disc, metal-poor and high-{$\alpha$} metal rich, high-{$\alpha$}, and
low-{$\alpha$} metal-poor populations. Both high-{$\alpha$} and low-{$\alpha$}
metal-poor populations are fully distinct in Mg, Cu, and Zn, but these
substructures are statistically indistinguishable in Mn and Ni. Thin
disc trends of [Ni/Fe] and [Cu/Fe] are very similar and show a small
increase at supersolar metallicities. Also, both thin and thick disc
trends of Ni and Cu are very similar and indistinguishable. Yet, Mn
looks very different from Ni and Cu. [Mn/Fe] trends of thin and thick
discs actually have noticeable differences: the thin disc is slightly Mn
richer than the thick disc. The [Zn/Fe] trends look very similar to
those of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] trends. The typical dispersion of results in both
discs is low ({\ap}0.05 dex for [Mg, Mn, and Cu/Fe]) and is even much
lower for [Ni/Fe] ({\ap}0.035 dex). <BR /> Conclusions: It is clearly
demonstrated that Zn is an {$\alpha$}-like element and could be used to
separate thin and thick disc stars. Moreover, we show that the [Mn/Mg]
ratio could also be a very good tool for tagging Galactic substructures.
From the comparison with Galactic chemical evolutionary models, we
conclude that some recent models can partially reproduce the observed
Mg, Zn, and, Cu behaviours in thin and thick discs and metal-poor
sequences. Models mostly fail to reproduce Mn and Ni in all metallicity
domains, however, models adopting yields normalised from solar chemical
properties reproduce Mn and Ni better, suggesting that there is still a
lack of realistic theoretical yields of some iron-peak elements. The
very low scatter ({\ap}0.05 dex) in thin and thick disc sequences could
provide an observational constrain for Galactic evolutionary models that
study the efficiency of stellar radial migration.

	Abstract = {{We calculate the evolution of heavy-element abundances from C to Zn in
the solar neighborhood, adopting our new nucleosynthesis yields. Our
yields are calculated for wide ranges of metallicity
(Z=0-Z$_{solar}$) and the explosion energy (normal supernovae and
hypernovae), based on the light-curve and spectra fitting of individual
supernovae. The elemental abundance ratios are in good agreement with
observations. Among the {$\alpha$}-elements, O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca show a
plateau at [Fe/H]$\lt$\~{}-1, while Ti is underabundant overall. The
observed abundance of Zn ([Zn/Fe]\~{}0) can be explained only by the
high-energy explosion models, as it requires a large contribution of
hypernovae. The observed decrease in the odd-Z elements (Na, Al, and Cu)
toward low [Fe/H] is reproduced by the metallicity effect on
nucleosynthesis. The iron-peak elements (Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) are
consistent with the observed mean values at -2.5$\lt$\~{}[Fe/H]$\lt$\~{}-1, and
the observed trend at the lower metallicity can be explained by the
energy effect. We also show the abundance ratios and the metallicity

been made in {\ap}100 individual red giant branch (RGB) stars in the
Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This is the largest sample of
individual Zn abundance measurements within a stellar system beyond the
Milky Way. In the observed metallicity range, -2.7 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le}
-0.9, the general trend of Zn abundances in Sculptor is similar to that
of {$\alpha$}-elements. That is, super-solar abundance ratios of [Zn/Fe] at
low metallicities, which decrease with increasing [Fe/H], eventually
reaching subsolar values. However, at the higher metallicities in
Sculptor, [Fe/H] {\gsim} -1.8, we find a significant scatter, -0.8 {\lsim}
[Zn/Fe] {\lsim} +0.4, which is not seen in any {$\alpha$}-element. Our
results are consistent with previous observations of a limited number of

that zinc has a complex nucleosynthetic origin, behaving neither
completely like an {$\alpha$}- nor an iron-peak element.

	Abstract = {{Context. Current models of galaxy formation predict that the Galactic
halo was assembled hierarchically. By measuring abundance ratios in
stars it may be possible to identify substructures in the halo resulting
from this process. <BR /> Aims: A previous study of 94 dwarf stars with
-1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4 in the solar neighborhood has revealed the
existence of two distinct halo populations with a systematic difference
in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] at a given metallicity. In continuation of that work,
abundances of Mn, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba are determined for the same sample
of stars. <BR /> Methods: Equivalent widths of atomic lines are measured
from high resolution VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectra and used to derive
abundance ratios from an LTE analysis based on MARCS model atmospheres.
The analysis is made relative to two thick-disk stars, <ASTROBJ>HD
22879</ASTROBJ> and <ASTROBJ>HD 76932</ASTROBJ>, such that very precise
differential values are obtained. <BR /> Results: Systematic differences
between the ``high-{$\alpha$}'' and ``low-{$\alpha$}'' halo populations are found
for [Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Ba/Y], whereas there is no significant
difference in the case of [Mn/Fe]. At a given metallicity, [Cu/Fe] shows
a large scatter that is closely correlated with a corresponding scatter
in [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe]. <BR /> Conclusions: The metallicity trends of
[Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Ba/Y] can be explained from existing
nucleosynthesis calculations if the high-{$\alpha$} stars formed in regions
with such a high star formation rate that only massive stars and type II
supernovae contributed to the chemical enrichment. The low-{$\alpha$}
stars, on the other hand, most likely originate from systems with a
slower chemical evolution, characterized by additional enrichment from
type Ia supernovae and low-mass AGB stars.

@article{Iwamoto1999,
	Abstract = {{The major uncertainties involved in the Chandrasekhar mass models for
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are related to the companion star of their
accreting white dwarf progenitor (which determines the accretion rate
and consequently the carbon ignition density) and the flame speed after
the carbon ignition. We calculate explosive nucleosynthesis in
relatively slow deflagrations with a variety of deflagration speeds and
ignition densities to put new constraints on the above key quantities.
The abundance of the Fe group, in particular of neutron-rich species
like $^{48}$Ca, $^{50}$Ti, $^{54}$Cr,
$^{54,58}$Fe, and $^{58}$Ni, is highly sensitive to the
electron captures taking place in the central layers. The yields
obtained from such a slow central deflagration, and from a fast
deflagration or delayed detonation in the outer layers, are combined and
put to comparison with solar isotopic abundances. To avoid excessively
large ratios of $^{54}$Cr/$^{56}$Fe and
$^{50}$Ti/$^{56}$Fe, the central density of the ''average''
white dwarf progenitor at ignition should be as low as
$\lt$\~{}2{\times}10$^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$. To avoid the
overproduction of $^{58}$Ni and $^{54}$Fe, either the flame
speed should not exceed a few percent of the sound speed in the central
low Y$_{e}$ layers or the metallicity of the average progenitors
has to be lower than solar. Such low central densities can be realized
by a rapid accretion as fast as {\.M}$\gt$\~{}1{\times}10$^{-7}$
M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$. In order to reproduce the solar
abundance of $^{48}$Ca, one also needs progenitor systems that
undergo ignition at higher densities. Even the smallest laminar flame
speeds after the low-density ignitions would not produce sufficient
amount of this isotope. We also found that the total amount of
$^{56}$Ni, the Si-Ca/Fe ratio, and the abundance of some elements
like Mn and Cr (originating from incomplete Si burning), depend on the
density of the deflagration-detonation transition in delayed
detonations. Our nucleosynthesis results favor transition densities
slightly below 2.2{\times}10$^{7}$ g cm$^{-3}$.

@article{BlandHawthorn2004,
	Abstract = {{How did the Galactic disk form and can the sequence of events ever be
unravelled from the vast stellar inventory? This will require that some
of the residual inhomogeneities from prehistory escaped the dissipative
process at an early stage. Fossil hunting to date has concentrated
mostly on the stellar halo, but a key source of information will be the
thick disk. This is believed to be a `snap frozen' relic which formed
during or shortly after the last major epoch of dissipation, or it may
have formed from infalling systems early in the life of the Galaxy. As
part of the KAOS Galaxy Genesis project, we explore the early history of
the halo and the thick disk by looking for discrete substructures,
either due to infall or in situ star formation, through chemical
tagging. This will require high signal-to-noise echelle spectroscopy of
up to a million stars throughout the disk. Our program has a short-term
and a long-term goal. The short-term goal is to quantify the size and
structure of the multi-dimensional chemical abundance space (C-space)
for all major components of the Galaxy. We seek to establish how many
axes in (C-space) are decoupled and have large intrinsic dispersions. A
critical test of chemical tagging in the short term is that stellar
streams in the halo, identified from detailed phase space information,
are highly localised in (C-space), or are confined to chemical tracks.
These trajectories presuppose that stars form in a closed box through
progressive enrichments of the gas, leading to stars dispersed along a
narrow track in a complex chemical space. The long-term goal is to
identify unique chemical signatures in the thick disk, originating from
different formation sites, for star clusters which have long since
dispersed. This will require precise chemical abundances for heavy
elements such that a star can be localised to a discrete point in
(C-space). If the star clusters originally formed outside the Galaxy in
a bound infalling system, the stellar abundances may fall along a
chemical track, rather than a discrete point in (C-space).

Atomic transition probabilities have been critically evaluated and

our consideration of all available theoretical and experimental

ion. Separate listings are given for ``allowed'' (electric dipole) and
``forbidden'' (magnetic dipole plus electric and magnetic quadrupole)
transitions. In each spectrum, lines are grouped into multiplets which
are arranged in order of ascending lower- and upper-level energies,
respectively. For each line, the emission transition probability
A$_{ki}$, the line strength S, and (for allowed lines) the
absorption oscillator strength f$_{ik}$ are given, together with
the spectroscopic designation, the wavelength, the statistical weights,
and the energy levels of the lower and upper states. The estimated
relative uncertainties of the line strength are also indicated, as are
the source citations. We include only those lines whose transition rates
are deemed sufficiently accurate to qualify as reference values. Short

Ia) using a sample of 132 SNe Ia, discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey II (SDSS2) among 66 000 galaxies with spectral-based star
formation histories (SFHs). To recover the best-fitting DTD, the SFH of
every individual galaxy is compared, using Poisson statistics, to the
number of SNe that it hosted (zero or one), based on the method
introduced in Maoz et al. This SN sample differs from the SDSS2 SN Ia
sample analysed by Brandt et al., using a related, but different, DTD
recovery method. Furthermore, we use a simulation-based SN
detection-efficiency function, and we apply a number of important
corrections to the galaxy SFHs and SN Ia visibility times. The DTD that
we find has 4{$\sigma$} detections in all three of its time bins: prompt
({$\tau$} $\lt$ 0.42 Gyr), intermediate (0.42 $\lt$ {$\tau$} $\lt$ 2.4 Gyr) and
delayed ({$\tau$} $\gt$ 2.4 Gyr), indicating a continuous DTD, and it is
among the most accurate and precise among recent DTD reconstructions.
The best-fitting power-law form to the recovered DTD is t$^{-1.07
$\pm$ 0.07}$, consistent with generic {\tilde}t$^{-1}$
predictions of SN Ia progenitor models based on the
gravitational-wave-induced mergers of binary white dwarfs. The
time-integrated number of SNe Ia per formed stellar mass is
N$_{SN}$/M = 0.00130 {\plusmn} 0.00015 
M$_{&sun;}$$^{-1}$, or about 4 per cent of the stars formed
with initial masses in the 3 - 8 M$_{&sun;}$ range. This is lower
than, but largely consistent with, several recent DTD estimates based on
SN rates in galaxy clusters and in local-volume galaxies, and is higher
than, but consistent with N$_{SN}$/M estimated by comparing
volumetric SN Ia rates to cosmic SFH.

metallicity distribution the authors find is best characterized by a sum
of three independent components, each with a well-defined mean abundance
and little or no gradient in this mean, but with very different spatial
density distributions. These components are identified as the Galactic
thin disk, the Galactic thick disk, and the Galactic extreme spheroid.
The relative number of stars in the solar vicinity in each of these
populations are very approximately 0.2:1.0:0.02:0.001 for the young
disk, the old disk, thick disk, and spheroid, respectively. The thick
disk is shown to have kinematic properties intermediate between the thin
disk and spheroid. The consequences of these results for theories of
Galaxy formation are briefly discussed.

	Abstract = {{We have undertaken the study of the elemental abundances and kinematic
properties of a metal-poor sample of candidate thick-disk stars selected
from the Radial Velocity Experiment spectroscopic survey of bright stars
to differentiate among the present scenarios of the formation of the
thick disk. In this paper, we report on a sample of 214 red giant
branch, 31 red clump/horizontal branch, and 74 main-sequence/sub-giant
branch metal-poor stars, which serves to augment our previous sample of
only giant stars. We find that the thick disk [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios are
enhanced and have little variation ($\lt$0.1 dex), in agreement with our
previous study. The augmented sample further allows, for the first time,
investigation of the gradients in the metal-poor thick disk. For stars
with [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.2, the thick disk shows very small gradients,
$\lt$0.03 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in {$\alpha$}-enhancement,
while we find a +0.01 {\plusmn} 0.04 dex kpc$^{-1}$ radial gradient
and a -0.09 {\plusmn} 0.05 dex kpc$^{-1}$ vertical gradient in iron
abundance. In addition, we show that the peak of the distribution of
orbital eccentricities for our sample agrees better with models in which
the stars that comprise the thick disk were formed primarily in the
Galaxy, with direct accretion of stars contributing little. Our results
thus disfavor direct accretion of stars from dwarf galaxies into the
thick disk as a major contributor to the thick-disk population, but
cannot discriminate between alternative models for the thick disk, such
as those that invoke high-redshift (gas-rich) mergers, heating of a
pre-existing thin stellar disk by a minor merger, or efficient radial
migration of stars.

	Abstract = {{Context. Mg is the {$\alpha$} element of choice for Galactic population and
chemical evolution studies because it is easily detectable in all
late-type stars. Such studies require precise elemental abundances, and
thus departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) need to be
accounted for. <BR /> Aims: Our goal is to provide reliable departure
coefficients and equivalent widths in non-LTE, and for reference in LTE,
for diagnostic lines of Mg studied in late-type stars. These can be
used, for example, to correct LTE spectra and abundances. <BR />
Methods: Using the model atom built and tested in the preceding paper in
this series, we performed non-LTE radiative transfer calculations in a
grid of 3945 stellar 1D atmospheric models. We used a sub-grid of 86
models to explore the propagation of errors in the recent atomic
collision calculations to the radiative transfer results. <BR />
Results: We obtained departure coefficients for all the levels and
equivalent widths (in LTE and non-LTE) for all the radiative transitions
included in the ``final'' model atom presented in Paper I. Here we present
and describe our results and show some examples of applications of the
data. The errors that result from uncertainties in the collisional data
are investigated and tabulated. The results for equivalent widths and
departure coefficients are made freely available. <BR /> Conclusions:
Giants tend to have negative abundance corrections while dwarfs have
positive, though small, corrections. Error analysis results show that
uncertainties related to the atomic collision data are typically on the
order of 0.01 dex or less, although for few stellar models in specific
lines uncertainties can be as large as 0.03 dex. As these errors are
less than or on the same order as typical corrections, we expect that we
can use these results to extract Mg abundances from high-quality spectra
more reliably than from classical LTE analysis.

how NLTE affects Mn abundances in cool stars of different metallicities.
<BR />Methods: The spectrum synthesis and Mn abundances are based on
statistical equilibrium calculations using various estimates for the
influence of hydrogen collisions.  <BR />Results: The NLTE abundances of
Mn in all studied stars are systematically higher than the LTE
abundances. At low metallicities, the NLTE abundance corrections may run
up to 0.5-0.7 dex. Instead of a strong depletion of Mn relative to Fe in
metal-poor stars as found by the other authors, we only find slightly
subsolar values of [Mn/Fe] throughout the range of metallicities
analyzed here. <BR />Conclusions: The [Mn/Fe] trend in metal-poor stars
is inconsistent with the predictions of galactic chemical evolution
models, where Mn is less produced than Fe.

	Abstract = {{The analysis of stellar abundances for odd-Z Fe-peak elements requires
accurate non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) modelling of
spectral lines fully taking into account the hyperfine structure (HFS)
splitting of lines. Here, we investigate the statistical equilibrium of
Co in the atmospheres of cool stars and the influence of NLTE and HFS on
the formation of Co lines and abundances. Significant departures from
LTE level populations are found for CoI number densities of excited
states in CoII also differ from LTE at low metallicity. The NLTE level
populations are used to determine the abundance of Co in solar
photosphere, log{$\epsilon$} = 4.95 +/- 0.04dex, which is in agreement with
that in CI meteorites within the combined uncertainties. The spectral
lines of CoI were calculated using the results of recent measurements of
hyperfine interaction constants by UV Fourier transform spectrometry.
For CoII, the first laboratory measurements of HFS A and B factors were
performed. These highly accurate A factor measurements (errors of the
order of 3-7 per cent) allow, for the first time, reliable modelling of
CoII lines in the solar and stellar spectra and, thus, a test of the
CoI/CoII ionization equilibrium in stellar atmospheres. A differential
abundance analysis of Co is carried out for 18 stars in the metallicity
range -3.12 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ 0. The abundances are derived by the method
of spectrum synthesis. At low [Fe/H], NLTE abundance corrections for CoI
lines are as large as +0.6,..., + 0.8dex. Thus, LTE abundances of Co in
metal-poor stars are severely underestimated. The stellar NLTE
abundances determined from the single UV line of CoII are lower by
\~{}0.5-0.6dex. The discrepancy might be attributed to possible blends that
have not been accounted for in the solar CoII line and its erroneous
oscillator strength. The increasing [Co/Fe] trend in metal-poor stars,
as calculated from the CoI lines under NLTE, can be explained if Co is
overproduced relative to Fe in massive stars. The models of Galactic
chemical evolution are wholly inadequate to describe this trend
suggesting that the problem is in supernova yields.

atmospheres of late-type stars. The Ti I/Ti II level populations are
computed with available experimental atomic data, except for
photoionization and collision-induced transition rates, for which we
have to rely on theoretical approximations. For the Sun, the non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation with adjusted H I
inelastic collision rates and MAFAGS-OS model atmosphere solve the
long-standing discrepancy between Ti I and Ti II lines. The NLTE
abundances determined from both ionization stages agree within 0.01 dex
with each other and with the Ti abundance in C I meteorites. The Ti NLTE
model does not perform similarly well for the metal-poor stars,
overestimating NLTE effects in the atmospheres of dwarfs, but
underestimating overionization for giants. Investigating different
sources of errors, we find that only [Ti/Fe] ratios based on Ti II and
Fe II lines can be safely used in studies of Galactic chemical
evolution. To avoid spurious abundance trends with metallicity and
dwarf/giant discrepancies, it is strongly recommended to disregard Ti I
lines in abundance analyses, as well as in determination of surface
gravities.

a star. The algorithm relies on the method of Bayesian inference, which
for the first time directly integrates the spectroscopic analysis

Arbitrary input data sets can be included into our analysis and other

surface gravity, and metallicity, can be computed on demand. We lay out
the mathematical framework of the method and apply it to several
observational data sets, including high- and low-resolution spectra

for the spectroscopic probability distribution function, which are
inherent to past Bayesian approaches, lead to deviations of several
standard deviations and unreliable errors on the same data. By its
flexibility and the simultaneous analysis of multiple independent
measurements for a star, it will be ideal to analyse and cross-calibrate

	Abstract = {{Stars born from the same molecular cloud should be nearly homogeneous in
their element abundances. The concept of chemical tagging is to identify
members of disrupted clusters by their clustering in element abundance
space. Chemical tagging requires large samples of stars with precise
abundances for many individual elements. With uncertainties of $\{${$\sigma$}

for 10 elements measured for $\backslash$gt $\{$10$\}$$^{4}$ stars, the APOGEE DR12
spectra may be the first well-suited data set to put this idea into
practice. We find that even APOGEE data offer only {\tilde}500 independent
volume elements in the 10-dimensional abundance space, when we focus on
the {$\alpha$}-enhanced Galactic disk. We develop and apply a new algorithm
to search for chemically homogeneous sets of stars against a dominant
background. By injecting star clusters into the APOGEE data set, we show
that chemically homogeneous clusters with masses {\gsim} 3{\times}
$\{$10$\}$$^{7}$ $\{$M$\}$$_{&sun; }$ would be easily detectable and
yet no such signal is seen in the data. By generalizing this approach,
we put a first abundance-based constraint on the cluster mass function
for the old disk stars in the Milky Way.

	Abstract = {{We study the IR-through-UV interstellar extinction curves towards 328
Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs
stellar atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened ``standard'' stars. This
technique is capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors
in the curves. It also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors
and enables a rigorous testing of the significance of relationships
between various curve parameters, regardless of whether their
uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the curves gives the following
results: (1) In accord with our previous findings, the central position
of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its width is highly
variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong correlations
are found among some extinction properties within the UV region, and
within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with
extreme (i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic
extinction curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large
sightline-to-sightline variation seen in our sample implies that any
average Galactic extinction curve will always reflect the biases of its
parent sample. (5) The use of an average curve to deredden a spectral
energy distribution (SED) will result in significant errors, and a
realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must include the observed
variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large
sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the
various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully
characterize average extinction properties, they demonstrate that
extinction curves respond sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each
curve contains potentially unique information about the grains along its
sightline.

short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create
frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star,
we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as
frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte

parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as
frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations $\{$$\{${$\Delta$}

with frequency and line widths at $\{${$\nu$} $\}$$_{\max }$ with
$\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior

line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and

	Abstract = {{Investigations of the origin and evolution of the Milky Way disc have
long relied on chemical and kinematic identifications of its components
to reconstruct our Galactic past. Difficulties in determining precise
stellar ages have restricted most studies to small samples, normally
confined to the solar neighbourhood. Here, we break this impasse with
the help of asteroseismic inference and perform a chronology of the
evolution of the disc throughout the age of the Galaxy. We chemically
dissect the Milky Way disc population using a sample of red giant stars
spanning out to 2 kpc in the solar annulus observed by the Kepler
satellite, with the added dimension of asteroseismic ages. Our results
reveal a clear difference in age between the low- and high-{$\alpha$}
populations, which also show distinct velocity dispersions in the V and
W components. We find no tight correlation between age and metallicity
nor [{$\alpha$}/Fe] for the high-{$\alpha$} disc stars. Our results indicate
that this component formed over a period of more than 2 Gyr with a wide
range of [M/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] independent of time. Our findings show
that the kinematic properties of young {$\alpha$}-rich stars are consistent
with the rest of the high-{$\alpha$} population and different from the
low-{$\alpha$} stars of similar age, rendering support to their origin
being old stars that went through a mass transfer or stellar merger
event, making them appear younger, instead of migration of truly young
stars formed close to the Galactic bar.

	Abstract = {{The discovery of lithium-rich giants contradicts expectations from
canonical stellar evolution. Here we report on the serendipitous
discovery of 20 Li-rich giants observed during the Gaia-ESO Survey,
which includes the first nine Li-rich giant stars known towards the
CoRoT fields. Most of our Li-rich giants have near-solar metallicities
and stellar parameters consistent with being before the luminosity bump.
This is difficult to reconcile with deep mixing models proposed to
explain lithium enrichment, because these models can only operate at
later evolutionary stages: at or past the luminosity bump. In an effort
to shed light on the Li-rich phenomenon, we highlight recent evidence of
the tidal destruction of close-in hot Jupiters at the sub-giant phase.
We note that when coupled with models of planet accretion, the observed
destruction of hot Jupiters actually predicts the existence of Li-rich
giant stars, and suggests that Li-rich stars should be found early on
the giant branch and occur more frequently with increasing metallicity.
A comprehensive review of all known Li-rich giant stars reveals that
this scenario is consistent with the data. However, more evolved or
metal-poor stars are less likely to host close-in giant planets,
implying that their Li-rich origin requires an alternative explanation,
likely related to mixing scenarios rather than external phenomena.

	Abstract = {{A large, perhaps dominant fraction, of the Milky Way's halo is thought
to be built up by the accretion of smaller galaxies and their globular
cluster (GC) systems. Here, we examine the Milky Way's GC system to
estimate the fraction of accreted versus in situ formed GCs. We first
assemble a high-quality data base of ages and metallicities for 93 Milky
Way GCs from literature deep colour-magnitude data. The age-metallicity
relation for Milky Way's GCs reveals two distinct tracks - one with near
constant old age of \~{}12.8 Gyr and the other branches to younger ages. We
find that the latter young track is dominated by GCs associated with the
Sagittarius and Canis Major dwarf galaxies. Despite being overly
simplistic, its age-metallicity relation can be well represented by a
simple closed box model with continuous star formation. The inferred
chemical enrichment history is similar to that of the Large Magellanic
Cloud, but is more enriched, at a given age, compared to the Small
Magellanic Cloud.

After excluding Sagittarius and Canis Major GCs, several young track GCs
remain. Their horizontal branch morphologies are often red and hence
classified as young halo objects; however, they do not tend to reveal
extended horizontal branches (a possible signature of an accreted
remnant nucleus). Retrograde orbit GCs (a key signature of accretion)
are commonly found in the young track. We also examine GCs that lie
close to the Fornax-Leo-Sculptor great circle defined by several
satellite galaxies. We find that several GCs are consistent with the
young track and we speculate that they may have been accreted along with
their host dwarf galaxy, whose nucleus may survive as a GC. Finally, we
suggest that 27-47 GCs (about 1/4 of the entire system), from six to
eight dwarf galaxies, were accreted to build the Milky Way GC system we
see today.

	Abstract = {{We present elemental abundances for 855 red giant branch (RGB) stars in
the globular cluster Omega Centauri ({$\omega$} Cen) from spectra obtained
with the Blanco 4 m telescope and Hydra multifiber spectrograph. The
sample includes nearly all RGB stars brighter than V = 13.5 and spans
{$\omega$} Cen's full metallicity range. The heavy {$\alpha$} elements (Si,
Ca, and Ti) are generally enhanced by \~{}+0.3 dex and exhibit a
metallicity-dependent morphology that may be attributed to mass and
metallicity-dependent Type II supernova (SN) yields. The heavy {$\alpha$}
and Fe-peak abundances suggest minimal contributions from Type Ia SNe.
The light elements (O, Na, and Al) exhibit $\gt$0.5 dex abundance
dispersions at all metallicities, and a majority of stars with
[Fe/H]$\gt$ - 1.6 have [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], and [Al/Fe] abundances similar to
those in monometallic globular clusters, as well as O-Na, O-Al
anticorrelations and the Na-Al correlation in all but the most
metal-rich stars. A combination of pollution from intermediate-mass
asymptotic giant branch stars and in situ mixing may explain the light
element abundance patterns. A large fraction (27\%) of {$\omega$} Cen stars
are O-poor ([O/Fe] $\lt$ 0) and are preferentially located within 5'-10'
of the cluster center. The O-poor giants are spatially similar, located
in the same metallicity range, and are present in nearly equal
proportions to blue main-sequence stars. This suggests that the O-poor
giants and blue main-sequence stars may share a common origin. [La/Fe]
increases sharply at [Fe/H] $\gt$\~{} -1.6, and the [La/Eu] ratios indicate
that the increase is due to almost pure s-process production.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We present the analysis of 26 nights of V and I time-series
observations from 2011 and 2012 of the globular cluster M 30 (NGC 7099).
We used our data to search for variable stars in this cluster and refine
the periods of known variables; we then used our variable star light
curves to derive values for the cluster's parameters. <BR /> Methods: We
used difference image analysis to reduce our data to obtain
high-precision light curves of variable stars. We then estimated the
cluster parameters by performing a Fourier decomposition of the light
curves of RR Lyrae stars for which a good period estimate was possible.
We also derived an estimate for the age of the cluster by fitting
theoretical isochrones to our colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). <BR />
Results: Out of 13 stars previously catalogued as variables, we find
that only 4 are bona fide variables. We detect two new RR Lyrae
variables, and confirm two additional RR Lyrae candidates from the
literature. We also detect four other new variables, including an
eclipsing blue straggler system, and an SX Phoenicis star. This amounts
to a total number of confirmed variable stars in M 30 of 12. We perform
Fourier decomposition of the light curves of the RR Lyrae stars to
derive cluster parameters using empirical relations. We find a cluster
metallicity [Fe/H]$_{ZW}$ = -2.01 {\plusmn} 0.04, or
[Fe/H]$_{UVES}$ = -2.11 {\plusmn} 0.06, and a distance of 8.32
{\plusmn} 0.20 kpc (using RR0 variables), 8.10 kpc (using one RR1
variable), and 8.35 {\plusmn} 0.42 kpc (using our SX Phoenicis star
detection in M 30). Fitting isochrones to the CMD, we estimate an age of
13.0 {\plusmn} 1.0 Gyr for M 30.

@article{Gratton2013,
	Abstract = {{To check the impact of the multiple population scenario for globular
clusters on their horizontal branch (HB), we present an analysis of the
composition of 110 red HB (RHB) stars in 47 Tucanae and of 61 blue HB
(BHB) and 30 RHB stars in M 5. In 47 Tuc we found tight relations
between the colours of the stars and their abundances of p-capture
elements. This strongly supports the idea that the He content - which is
expected to be closely correlated with the abundances of p-capture
elements - is the third parameter (after overall metallicity and age)
that determines the colour of HB stars. However, the range in He
abundance must be small ({$\Delta$}Y $\lt$ 0.03) in 47 Tuc to reproduce our
observations; this agrees with previous analyses. There is possibly a
correlation between the abundances of p- and n-capture elements in 47
Tuc. If confirmed, this might suggest that asymptotic giant branch stars
of moderate mass contributed to the gas from which second-generation
stars formed. Considering the selection effects in our sample (which
does not include stars warmer than 11 000 K and RR Lyrae variables,
which were excluded because we could not obtain accurate abundances with
the adopted observing procedure) is important to understand our results
for M 5. In this case, we find that, as expected, RHB stars are Na-poor
and O-rich, and likely belong to the primordial population. There is a
clear correlation of the [Na/O] ratio and N abundance with colour along
the BHB. A derivation of the He abundance for these stars yields a low
value of Y = 0.22 {\plusmn} 0.03. This is expected because HB stars of a
putative He-rich population in this cluster should be warmer than 11 000
K, and would accordingly not have been sampled by our analysis. However,
we need some additional source of scatter in the total mass loss of
stars climbing up the red giant branch to reproduce our results for M 5.
Finally, we found a C-star on the HB of 47 Tuc and a Ba-rich,
fast-rotating, likely binary star on the HB of M 5. These stars are
among the brightest and coolest HB stars.

	Abstract = {{Precise studies on the Galactic bulge, globular cluster, Galactic halo,
and Galactic thick disc require stellar models with {$\alpha$} enhancement
and various values of helium content. These models are also important
for extra-Galactic population synthesis studies. For this purpose, we
complement the existing PARSEC models, which are based on the solar
partition of heavy elements, with {$\alpha$}-enhanced partitions. We
collect detailed measurements on the metal mixture and helium abundance
for the two populations of 47 Tuc (NGC 104) from the literature, and
calculate stellar tracks and isochrones with these {$\alpha$}-enhanced
compositions. By fitting the precise colour-magnitude diagram with HST
ACS/WFC data, from low main sequence till horizontal branch (HB), we
calibrate some free parameters that are important for the evolution of
low mass stars like the mixing at the bottom of the convective envelope.
This new calibration significantly improves the prediction of the red
giant branch bump (RGBB) brightness. Comparison with the observed RGB
and HB luminosity functions also shows that the evolutionary lifetimes
are correctly predicted. As a further result of this calibration
process, we derive the age, distance modulus, reddening, and the RGB
mass-loss for 47 Tuc. We apply the new calibration and {$\alpha$}-enhanced
mixtures of the two 47 Tuc populations ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] {\tilde} 0.4 and
0.2) to other metallicities. The new models reproduce the RGB bump
observations much better than previous models. This new PARSEC data
base, with the newly updated {$\alpha$}-enhanced stellar evolutionary
tracks and isochrones, will also be a part of the new stellar products
for Gaia.

	Abstract = {{The existence of a vertical age gradient in the Milky Way disc has been
indirectly known for long. Here, we measure it directly for the first
time with seismic ages, using red giants observed by Kepler. We use
Str{\"o}mgren photometry to gauge the selection function of
asteroseismic targets, and derive colour and magnitude limits where
giants with measured oscillations are representative of the underlying
population in the field. Limits in the 2MASS system are also derived. We
lay out a method to assess and correct for target selection effects
independent of Galaxy models. We find that low-mass, I.e. old red giants
dominate at increasing Galactic heights, whereas closer to the Galactic
plane they exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. Parametrizing
this as a vertical gradient returns approximately 4 Gyr kpc$^{-1}$
for the disc we probe, although with a large dispersion of ages at all
heights. The ages of stars show a smooth distribution over the last
{\sime}10 Gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescent evolution for the Milky
Way disc since a redshift of about 2. We also find a flat
age-metallicity relation for disc stars. Finally, we show how to use
secondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity
spread, and suggest using their number count as a new proxy for tracing
the ageing of the disc. This work highlights the power of
asteroseismology for Galactic studies; however, we also emphasize the
need for better constraints on stellar mass-loss, which is a major
source of systematic age uncertainties in red giant stars.

	Abstract = {{Setting the timeline of the events which shaped the Milky Way disc
through its 13 billion year old history is one of the major challenges
in the theory of galaxy formation. Achieving this goal is possible using
late-type stars, which in virtue of their long lifetimes can be regarded
as fossil remnants from various epochs of the formation of the Galaxy.
There are two main paths to reliably age-date late-type stars:
astrometric distances for stars in the turn-off and subgiant region, or
oscillation frequencies along the red giant branch. So far, these
methods have been applied to large samples of stars in the solar
neighbourhood, and in the Kepler field. I review these studies,
emphasize how they complement each other, and highlight some of the
constraints they provide for Galactic modelling. I conclude with the
prospects and synergies that astrometric ($\{$Gaia$\}$) and asteroseismic
space-borne missions reserve to the field of Galactic archaeology, and
advocate that survey selection functions should be kept as simple as
possible, relying on basic observables such as colours and magnitudes
only.

evolution. Previously, the disc's structure has been studied in terms of
populations defined geometrically and/or chemically, but a decomposition
based on stellar ages provides a more direct connection to the history
of the disc, and stronger constraint on theory. Here, we use positions,
abundances and ages for 31 244 red giant branch stars from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-APOGEE survey, spanning 3 $\lt$ R$_{gc}$
$\lt$ 15 kpc, to dissect the disc into mono-age and mono-[Fe/H]
populations at low and high [{$\alpha$}/Fe]. For each population, with
{$\Delta$}age $\lt$ 2 Gyr and {$\Delta$}[Fe/H] $\lt$ 0.1 dex, we measure the
structure and surface-mass density contribution. We find that low
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] mono-age populations are fit well by a broken exponential,
which increases to a peak radius and decreases thereafter. We show that
this profile becomes broader with age, interpreted here as a new signal
of disc heating and radial migration. High [{$\alpha$}/Fe] populations are
well fit as single exponentials within the radial range considered, with
an average scalelength of 1.9 {\plusmn} 0.1 kpc. We find that the
relative contribution of high to low [{$\alpha$}/Fe] populations at
R$_{0}$ is f\_{$\Sigma$} = 18 per cent {\plusmn} 5 per cent; high
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] contributes most of the mass at old ages, and low
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] at young ages. The low and high [{$\alpha$}/Fe] populations
overlap in age at intermediate [Fe/H], although both contribute mass at
R$_{0}$ across the full range of [Fe/H]. The mass-weighted
scaleheight h$_{Z}$ distribution is a smoothly declining
exponential function. High [{$\alpha$}/Fe] populations are thicker than low
[{$\alpha$}/Fe], and the average h$_{Z}$ increases steadily with age,
between 200 and 600 pc.

	Abstract = {{We study seven simulated disc galaxies, three with a quiescent merger
history, and four with mergers in their last 9 Gyr of evolution. We
compare their structure at z = 0 by decomposing them into `mono-age
populations' (MAPs) of stars within 500 Myr age bins. All studied
galaxies undergo a phase of merging activity at high redshift, so that
stars older than 9 Gyr are found in a centrally concentrated component,
while younger stars are mostly found in discs. We find that most MAPs
have simple exponential radial and vertical density profiles, with a
scaleheight that typically increases with age. Because a large range of
merger histories can create populations with simple structures, this
suggests that the simplicity of the structure of mono-abundance
populations observed in the Milky Way by Bovy et al. is not necessarily
a direct indicator of a quiescent history for the Milky Way. Similarly,
the anticorrelation between scalelength and scaleheight does not
necessarily imply a merger-free history. However, mergers produce
discontinuities between thin and thick disc components, and jumps in the
age-velocity relation. The absence of a structural discontinuity between
thin and thick disc observed in the Milky Way would seem to be a good
indicator that no merger with a mass ratio larger than 1:15-1:10
occurred in the last 9 Gyr. Mergers at higher redshift might
nevertheless be necessary to produce the thickest, hottest components of
the Milky Way's disc.

	Abstract = {{We analyze the present day structure and assembly history of a
high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the formation of a
Milky-Way-(MW)-like disk galaxy, from the ``Eris'' simulation suite,
dissecting it into cohorts of stars formed at different epochs of cosmic
history. At z = 0, stars with t $_{form}$ $\lt$ 2 Gyr mainly occupy
the stellar spheroid, with the oldest (earliest forming) stars having
more centrally concentrated profiles. The younger age cohorts populate
disks of progressively longer radial scale lengths and shorter vertical
scale heights. At a given radius, the vertical density profiles and
velocity dispersions of stars vary smoothly as a function of age, and
the superposition of old, vertically extended and young, vertically
compact cohorts gives rise to a double-exponential profile like that
observed in the MW. Turning to formation history, we find that the
trends of spatial structure and kinematics with stellar age are largely
imprinted at birth, or immediately thereafter. Stars that form during
the active merger phase at z $\gt$ 3 are quickly scattered into rounded,
kinematically hot configurations. The oldest disk cohorts form in
structures that are radially compact and relatively thick, while
subsequent cohorts form in progressively larger, thinner, colder
configurations from gas with increasing levels of rotational support.
The disk thus forms ``inside out'' in a radial sense and ``upside down'' in
a vertical sense. Secular heating and radial migration influence the
final state of each age cohort, but the changes they produce are small
compared to the trends established at formation. The predicted
correlations of stellar age with spatial and kinematic structure are in
good qualitative agreement with the correlations observed for
mono-abundance stellar populations in the MW.

most recent ideas on stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova (SN)
progenitors are taken into account. It is assumed that the disk forms by
accretion of primordial material coming from outside with a time-scale
which is a function of the galactocentric distance. The possibility of
forming the disk out of enriched halo gas is also studied in a simple
way. The evolution of the abundances of several single elements is
predicted as well as that of gas mass, SN rates and star formation rate,
both in the solar neighborhood and in the whole disk, under different
assumptions for the star formation rate. Abundance gradients along the
galactic disk are well reproduced and a possible interpretation for the
differences among gradients of different elements is given in terms of
nucleosynthesis and stellar lifetimes. This interpretation can represent
a key for understanding gradients also in external galaxies. In
particular, a natural explanation is suggested for the positive gradient
of S/O, found in M101 and M33.

@article{Gruyters2016,
	Abstract = {{Context. The prediction of the Planck-constrained primordial lithium
abundance in the Universe is in discordance with the observed Li
abundances in warm Population II dwarf and subgiant stars. Among the
physically best motivated ideas, it has been suggested that this
discrepancy can be alleviated if the stars observed today had undergone
photospheric depletion of lithium. <BR /> Aims: The cause of this
depletion is investigated by accurately tracing the behaviour of the
lithium abundances as a function of effective temperature. Globular
clusters are ideal laboratories for such an abundance analysis as the
relative stellar parameters of their stars can be precisely determined.
<BR /> Methods: We performed a homogeneous chemical abundance analysis
of 144 stars in the metal-poor globular cluster M30, ranging from the
cluster turnoff point to the tip of the red giant branch. Non-local
thermal equilibrium (NLTE) abundances for Li, Ca, and Fe were derived
where possible by fitting spectra obtained with VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE using
the quantitative-spectroscopy package SME. Stellar parameters were
derived by matching isochrones to the observed V vs. V-I
colour-magnitude diagram. Independent effective temperatures were
obtained from automated profile fitting of the Balmer lines and by
applying colour-T$_{eff}$ calibrations to the broadband
photometry. <BR /> Results: Li abundances of the turnoff and early
subgiant stars form a thin plateau that is broken off abruptly in the
middle of the SGB as a result of the onset of Li dilution caused by the
first dredge-up. Abundance trends with effective temperature for Fe and
Ca are observed and compared to predictions from stellar structure
models including atomic diffusion and ad hoc additional mixing below the
surface convection zone. The comparison shows that the stars in M30 are
affected by atomic diffusion and additional mixing, but we were unable
to determine the efficiency of the additional mixing precisely. This is
the fourth globular cluster (after NGC 6397, NGC 6752, and M4) in which
atomic diffusion signatures are detected. After applying a conservative
correction (T6.0 model) for atomic diffusion, we find an initial Li
abundance of A(Li) = 2.48 {\plusmn} 0.10 for the globular cluster M30. We
also detected a Li-rich SGB star with a Li abundance of A(Li) = 2.39.
The finding makes Li-rich mass transfer a likely scenario for this star
and rules out models in which its Li enhancement is created during the
RGB bump phase.

	Abstract = {{Photospheric abundances are presented for 27 elements from carbon to
europium in 181 F and G dwarfs from a differential local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) analysis of high-resolution and high signal-to-noise
ratio spectra. Stellar effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$) were
adopted from an infrared flux method calibration of Str{\"o}mgren
photometry. Stellar surface gravities (g) were calculated from Hipparcos
parallaxes and stellar evolutionary tracks. Adopted T$_{eff}$ and
g values are in good agreement with spectroscopic estimates. Stellar
ages were determined from evolutionary tracks. Stellar space motions (U,
V, W) and a Galactic potential were used to estimate Galactic orbital
parameters. These show that the vast majority of the stars belong to the
Galactic thin disc.

Relative abundances expressed as [X/Fe] generally confirm previously
published results. We give results for C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K,
Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd and Eu. The
{$\alpha$} elements - O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti - show [{$\alpha$}/Fe] to increase
slightly with decreasing [Fe/H]. Heavy elements with dominant
contributions at solar metallicity from the s-process show [s/Fe] to
decrease slightly with decreasing [Fe/H]. Scatter in [X/Fe] at a fixed
[Fe/H] is entirely attributable to the small measurement errors, after
excluding the few thick disc stars and the s-process-enriched CH
subgiants. Tight limits are set on `cosmic' scatter. If a weak trend
with [Fe/H] is taken into account, the composition of a thin disc star
expressed as [X/Fe] is independent of the star's age and birthplace for
elements contributed in different proportions by massive stars (Type II
supernovae), exploding white dwarfs (Type Ia supernovae) and asymptotic
red giant branch stars.

By combining our sample with various published studies, comparisons
between thin and thick disc stars are made. In this composite sample,
thick disc stars are primarily identified by their V$_{LSR}$ in
the range -40 to -100 km s$^{-1}$. These are very old stars with
origins in the inner Galaxy and metallicities [Fe/H]$\lt$=-0.4. At the
same [Fe/H], the sampled thin disc stars have V$_{LSR}$\~{} 0 km
s$^{-1}$, and are generally younger with a birthplace at about the
Sun's Galactocentric distance. In the range -0.35 $\gt$=[Fe/H]$\gt$=-0.70,
well represented by present thin and thick disc samples, [X/Fe] of the
thick disc stars is greater than that of thin disc stars for Mg, Al, Si,
Ca, Ti and Eu. [X/Fe] is very similar for the thin and thick disc for -
notably - Na and iron-group elements. Barium ([Ba/Fe]) may be
underabundant in thick relative to thin disc stars. These results extend
previous ideas about composition differences between the thin and thick
disc.

	Abstract = {{Absolute oscillator strengths of neutral cobalt have been determined
from hook measurements for 159 transitions and emission intensity
measurements for 314 transitions between 2276 {\AA} and 9357 {\AA}.
Ninety-five of these transitions were subjected to the procedure
developed by Cardon, Smith, and Whaling which fits combined absorption
and emission data to a set of consistent, optimum, relative oscillator
strengths and upper level lifetimes. These relative values were
normalized to the radiative lifetimes of Figger et al. and of Marek and
Vogt obtained by pulsed laser fluorescence. Absolute oscillator
strengths for 362 transitions and 36 lifetimes were determined. Typical
uncertainties in the reported absolute oscillator strengths are
{\plusmn}15-25\% (2/3 confidence level).

Equivalent widths were obtained for nineteen solar cobalt lines with the
McMath solar telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. These widths
were used to redetermine the solar cobalt abundance, assuming the
photospheric model of Holweger and a microturbulence velocity of 1.0 km
s$^{-1}$. The adopted solar cobalt abundance is the mean value log
Co/N$_{H}$$\gt$ + 12 = 4.92 {\plusmn} 0.08 ({\plusmn}19\%), from the
19 cobalt transitions. This value is in excellent agreement with the
solar values of Ross and Aller, of Biemont, and of Holweger and that of
Cameron for carbonaceous chondrites.

	Abstract = {{Atomic transition probability measurements for 371 Ni I lines in the UV
through near-IR are reported. Branching fractions from data recorded
using a Fourier transform spectrometer and a new echelle spectrograph
are combined with published radiative lifetimes to determine these
transition probabilities. Generally good agreement is found in
comparisons to previously reported Ni I transition probability
measurements. Use of the new echelle spectrograph, independent
radiometric calibration methods, and independent data analysis routines
enable a reduction of systematic errors and overall improvement in
transition probability uncertainty over previous measurements. The new
Ni I data are applied to high-resolution visible and UV spectra of the
Sun and metal-poor star HD 84937 to derive new, more accurate Ni
abundances. Lines covering a wide range of wavelength and excitation
potential are used to search for non-LTE effects.

strengths calculated by Biemont and Godefroid (1979), with the effects
of microturbulence taken into account. Abundances of 4.59 plus or minus

wavelength range 4000-8000 {\AA}. Our gf-values are both accurate and
precise, because each multiplet was globally normalized using laboratory
data (accuracy), while the relative gf-values of individual lines within
a given multiplet were obtained from theoretical calculations
(precision). Our line list was tested with the Sun and high-resolution
(R {\ap} 10\^{}5), high-S/N ({\ap}700-900) Keck+HIRES spectra of the
metal-poor stars HD 148816 and HD 140283, for which line-to-line scatter
({$\sigma$}) in the iron abundances from Fe II lines as low as 0.03, 0.04,
and 0.05 dex are found, respectively. For these three stars the standard
error in the mean iron abundance from Fe II lines is negligible
({$\sigma$}\_mean {\le} 0.01 dex). The mean solar iron abundance obtained
using our gf-values and different model atmospheres is A\_Fe = 7.45

	Abstract = {{The Gaia-ESO survey (GES) is now in its fifth and last year of
observations and has produced tens of thousands of high-quality spectra
of stars in all Milky Way components. This paper presents the strategy
behind the selection of astrophysical calibration targets, ensuring that
all GES results on radial velocities, atmospheric parameters, and
chemical abundance ratios will be both internally consistent and easily
comparable with other literature results, especially from other large
spectroscopic surveys and from Gaia. The calibration of GES is
particularly delicate because of (I) the large space of parameters
covered by its targets, ranging from dwarfs to giants, from O to M
stars; these targets have a large wide of metallicities and also include
fast rotators, emission line objects, and stars affected by veiling;
(II) the variety of observing setups, with different wavelength ranges
and resolution; and (III) the choice of analyzing the data with many
different state-of-the-art methods, each stronger in a different region
of the parameter space, which ensures a better understanding of
systematic uncertainties. An overview of the GES calibration and
homogenization strategy is also given, along with some examples of the
usage and results of calibrators in GES iDR4, which is the fourth
internal GES data release and will form the basis of the next GES public
data release. The agreement between GES iDR4 recommended values and
reference values for the calibrating objects are very satisfactory. The
average offsets and spreads are generally compatible with the GES
measurement errors, which in iDR4 data already meet the requirements set
by the main GES scientific goals.

@article{Ness2018,
	Abstract = {{We explore to what extent stars within Galactic disk open clusters
resemble each other in the high-dimensional space of their photospheric
element abundances and contrast this with pairs of field stars. Our
analysis is based on abundances for 20 elements, homogeneously derived
from APOGEE spectra (with carefully quantified uncertainties of
typically 0.03 dex). We consider 90 red giant stars in seven open
clusters and find that most stars within a cluster have abundances in
most elements that are indistinguishable (in a $\{${$\chi$}
$\}$$^{2}$-sense) from those of the other members, as expected for
stellar birth siblings. An analogous analysis among pairs of $\gt$ 1000
field stars shows that highly significant abundance differences in the
20 dimensional space can be established for the vast majority of these
pairs, and that the APOGEE-based abundance measurements have high
discriminating power. However, pairs of field stars whose abundances are
indistinguishable even at 0.03 dex precision exist: {\sim}0.3\% of all
field star pairs and {\sim}1.0\% of field star pairs at the same (solar)
metallicity [Fe/H] = 0 {\plusmn} 0.02. Most of these pairs are presumably
not birth siblings from the same cluster, but rather doppelg{\"a}ngers.
Our analysis implies that {\ldquo}chemical tagging{\rdquo} in the strict
sense, identifying birth siblings for typical disk stars through their
abundance similarity alone, will not work with such data. However, our
approach shows that abundances have extremely valuable information for
probabilistic chemo-orbital modeling, and combined with velocities, we
have identified new cluster members from the field.

	Abstract = {{Atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions for 10 stars with
metallicities in the region of -2.2 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.6 were precisely
determined using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise, spectra. For
each star, the abundances, for 14-27 elements, were derived using both
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE (NLTE) approaches. In
particular, differences by assuming LTE or NLTE are about 0.10 dex;
depending on [Fe/H], T$_{eff}$, gravity and element lines used in
the analysis. We find that the O abundance has the largest error,
ranging from 0.10 and 0.2 dex. The best measured elements are Cr, Fe,
and Mn; with errors between 0.03 and 0.11 dex. The stars in our sample
were included in previous different observational work. We provide a
consistent data analysis. The data dispersion introduced in the
literature by different techniques and assumptions used by the different
authors is within the observational errors, excepting for HD103095. We
compare these results with stellar observations from different data sets
and a number of theoretical galactic chemical evolution (GCE)
simulations. We find a large scatter in the GCE results, used to study
the origin of the elements. Within this scatter as found in previous GCE
simulations, we cannot reproduce the evolution of the elemental ratios
[Sc/Fe], [Ti/Fe], and [V/Fe] at different metallicities. The stellar
yields from core-collapse supernovae are likely primarily responsible
for this discrepancy. Possible solutions and open problems are
discussed.

	Abstract = {{Core helium burning primary red clump (RC) stars are evolved red giant
stars that are excellent standard candles. As such, these stars are
routinely used to map the Milky Way or determine the distance to other
galaxies, among other things. However, distinguishing RC stars from
their less evolved precursors, namely red giant branch (RGB) stars, is
still a difficult challenge and has been deemed the domain of
asteroseismology. In this paper, we use a sample of 1676 RGB and RC
stars that have both single epoch infrared spectra from the APOGEE
survey and asteroseismic parameters and classification to show that the
spectra alone can be used to (1) predict asteroseismic parameters with
precision high enough to (2) distinguish core helium burning RC from
other giant stars with less than 2\% contamination. This will not only
allow for a clean selection of a large number of standard candles across
our own and other galaxies from spectroscopic surveys, but also will
remove one of the primary roadblocks for stellar evolution studies of
mixing and mass loss in red giant stars.

	Abstract = {{The observable spectrum of an unresolved binary star system is a
superposition of two single-star spectra. Even without a detectable
velocity offset between the two stellar components, the combined
spectrum of a binary system is in general different from that of either
component, and fitting it with single-star models may yield inaccurate
stellar parameters and abundances. We perform simple experiments with
synthetic spectra to investigate the effect of unresolved main-sequence
binaries on spectral fitting, modelling spectra similar to those
collected by the APOGEE, GALAH and LAMOST surveys. We find that fitting
unresolved binaries with single-star models introduces systematic biases
in the derived stellar parameters and abundances that are modest but
certainly not negligible, with typical systematic errors of 300 K in
T$_{eff}$, 0.1 dex in log g and 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] for APOGEE-like
spectra of solar-type stars. These biases are smaller for spectra at
optical wavelengths than in the near-infrared. We show that biases can
be corrected by fitting spectra with a binary model, which adds only two
labels to the fit and includes single-star models as a special case. Our
model provides a promising new method to constrain the Galactic binary
population, including systems with single-epoch spectra and no
detectable velocity offset between the two stars.

	Abstract = {{The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), one
of the programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), has now
completed its systematic, homogeneous spectroscopic survey sampling all
major populations of the Milky Way. After a three-year observing
campaign on the Sloan 2.5 m Telescope, APOGEE has collected a half
million high-resolution (R {\tilde} 22,500), high signal-to-noise ratio
($\gt$100), infrared (1.51-1.70 {$\mu$}m) spectra for 146,000 stars,
with time series information via repeat visits to most of these stars.
This paper describes the motivations for the survey and its overall
design{\mdash}hardware, field placement, target selection,
operations{\mdash}and gives an overview of these aspects as well as the
data reduction, analysis, and products. An index is also given to the
complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey
components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey
performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data
products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from
time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity
variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics,
metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function
of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star
clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species. As part of SDSS-III
Data Release 12 and later releases, all of the APOGEE data products are
publicly available.

	Abstract = {{The chemical abundance patterns of the oldest stars in the Galaxy are
expected to contain residual signatures of the first stars in the early
universe. Numerous studies attempt to explain the intrinsic abundance
scatter observed in some metal-poor populations in terms of chemical
inhomogeneities dispersed throughout the early Galactic medium due to
discrete enrichment events. Just how the complex data and models are to
be interpreted with respect to ``progenitor yields'' remains an open
question. Here we show that stochastic chemical evolution models to date
have overlooked a crucial fact. Essentially, all stars today are born in
highly homogeneous star clusters and it is likely that this was also
true at early times. When this ingredient is included, the overall
scatter in the abundance plane [Fe/H] versus [X/Fe] ($\{$C$\}$-space), where X
is a nucleosynthetic element, can be much less than derived from earlier
models. Moreover, for moderately flat cluster mass functions ({$\gamma$}
$\lt$\~{} 2), and/or for mass functions with a high mass cutoff (M
$_{max}$ $\gt$\~{} 10$^{5}$ M $_{sun}$), stars exhibit a
high degree of clumping in $\{$C$\}$-space that can be identified even in
relatively small data samples. Since stellar abundances can be modified
by mass transfer in close binaries, clustered signatures are essential
for deriving the yields of the first supernovae. We present a
statistical test to determine whether a given set of observations
exhibit such behavior. Our initial work focuses on two dimensions in
$\{$C$\}$-space, but we show that the clustering signal can be greatly
enhanced by additional abundance axes. The proposed experiment will be
challenging on existing 8-10 m telescopes, but relatively
straightforward for a multi-object echelle spectrograph mounted on a
25-40 m telescope.

@article{BlandHawthorn2010a,
	Abstract = {{The Galactic disk retains vast amount of information about how it came
to be and how it evolved over cosmic time. However, we know very little
about the secular processes associated with disk evolution. One major
uncertainty is the extent to which stars migrate radially through the
disk, thereby washing out signatures of their past (e.g., birth sites).
Recent theoretical work finds that such ``blurring'' of the disk can be
important if spiral arms are transient phenomena. Here we describe an
experiment to determine the importance of diffusion from the Solar
circle with cosmic time. Consider a star cluster that has been placed
into a differentially rotating, stellar fluid. We show that all clusters
up to \~{}10$^{4}$ M $_{sun}$ in mass, and a significant
fraction of those up to \~{}10$^{5}$ M $_{sun}$, are expected
to be chemically homogeneous, and that clusters of this size can be
assigned a unique ``chemical tag'' by measuring the abundances of lsim10
independent element groups, with better age and orbit determinations
allowing fewer abundance measurements. The star cluster therefore acts
like a ``tracer dye,'' and the present-day distribution of its stars
provides a strong constraint on the rate of radial diffusion or
migration in the Galactic disk. A star cluster of particular interest
for this application is the ``Solar family''{\mdash}the stars that were
born with the Sun. If we were able to identify a significant fraction of
these, we could determine whether the Sun was born at its present radius
or much further in. We show all-sky projections for the Solar family
under different dynamical scenarios and identify the most advantageous
fields on the sky for the experiment. Sellwood {\amp} Binney have argued
for strong radial transport driven by transient spiral perturbations: in
principle, we could measure the strength of this migration directly. In
searching for the Solar family, we would also identify many thousands of
other chemically homogeneous groups, providing a wealth of additional
information. We discuss this prospect in the context of the upcoming
HERMES high-resolution million-star survey.

	Abstract = {{We introduce a stable, well tested Python implementation of the
affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
proposed by Goodman {\amp} Weare (2010). The code is open source and has
already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics
literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over
traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as
measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent
sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires
hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to {\tilde}N$^{2}$
for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this
document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our
implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee
permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra
effort. The code is available online at <A

	Abstract = {{We report homogeneous spectroscopic determinations of the effective
temperature, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for the host
stars of 56 transiting planets. Our analysis is based primarily on the
stellar parameter classification (SPC) technique. We investigate
systematic errors by examining subsets of the data with two other
methods that have often been used in previous studies (Spectroscopy Made
Easy (SME) and MOOG). The SPC and SME results, both based on comparisons
between synthetic spectra and actual spectra, show strong correlations
between T $_{eff}$, [Fe/H], and log g when solving for all three
quantities simultaneously. In contrast the MOOG results, based on a more
traditional curve-of-growth approach, show no such correlations. To
combat the correlations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and
metallicities, we repeat the SPC analysis with a constraint on log g
based on the mean stellar density that can be derived from the analysis
of the transit light curves. Previous studies that have not taken
advantage of this constraint have been subject to systematic errors in
the stellar masses and radii of up to 20\% and 10\%, respectively, which
can be larger than other observational uncertainties, and which also
cause systematic errors in the planetary mass and radius.

volume-complete all-sky survey of the about 500 bright stars with
distances less than 25 pc and down to main-sequence effective
temperatures T$_{eff}$ {\ge} 5300 K. The sample is dominated by a
93 per cent fraction of Population I stars, only 22 sources (5 per cent)
are Population II stars, and 9 sources (2 per cent) are
intermediate-disc stars. No source belongs to the halo. By following the
mass of the stars instead of their light, the resulting subset of 136
long-lived stars distributes as 22 (16.2 per cent):6 (4.4 per cent):108
(79.4 per cent) for the Population II:intermediate disc:Population I,
respectively. Along with the much larger scaleheight reached by
Population II, this unbiased census of long-lived stars provides plain
evidence for a starburst epoch in the early Milky Way, with the
formation of a massive, rotationally supported, and dark Population II.
The same conclusion arises from the substantial early chemical
enrichment levels, exemplified here by the elements magnesium and iron,
as it arises also from the local Population II white dwarfs. The
kinematics, metallicity distribution functions, star formation rates,
age-metallicity relations, the inventory of young stars, and the
occurrence of blue straggler stars are discussed. A potentially new
aspect of the survey is the possibility for substructure among the local
Population II stars that may further subdivide into metal-poor and
metal-rich sources.

422 stars with distances less than 25 pc and primary main-sequence
effective temperatures T $_{eff}$ {\ge} 5300 K. Very similar to
previous results that have been presented for various subsets of this
survey, we confirm the positive correlation of the stellar
multiplicities with primary mass. We find for the F- and G-type
Population I stars that 58\% are non-single and 21\% are in triple or
higher level systems. For the old intermediate-disk and Population II
stars{\mdash}virtually all of G type and less massive{\mdash}even two out
of three sources prove to be non-single. These numbers being lower
limits because of the continuous flow of new discoveries, the unbiased
survey clearly demonstrates that the standard case for solar-type field
stars is a hydrogen-burning source with at least one ordinary or
degenerate stellar companion, and a surprisingly large number of stars
are organized in multiple systems. A principal consequence is that
orbital evolution, including the formation of blue straggler stars, is a
potentially important issue on all spatial scales and timescales for a
significant percentage of the stellar systems, in particular among
Population II stars. We discuss a number of recent observations of known
or suspected companions in the local survey, including a new detection
of a double-lined Ba-Bb subsystem to the visual binary HR 8635.

high-resolution infrared spectroscopic survey spanning all Galactic
environments (i.e., bulge, disk, and halo), with the principal goal of
constraining dynamical and chemical evolution models of the Milky Way.
APOGEE takes advantage of the reduced effects of extinction at infrared
wavelengths to observe the inner Galaxy and bulge at an unprecedented
level of detail. The survey's broad spatial and wavelength coverage
enables users of APOGEE data to address numerous Galactic structure and
stellar populations issues. In this paper we describe the APOGEE
targeting scheme and document its various target classes to provide the
necessary background and reference information to analyze samples of
APOGEE data with awareness of the imposed selection criteria and
resulting sample properties. APOGEE's primary sample consists of
\~{}10$^{5}$ red giant stars, selected to minimize observational
biases in age and metallicity. We present the methodology and
considerations that drive the selection of this sample and evaluate the
accuracy, efficiency, and caveats of the selection and sampling
algorithms. We also describe additional target classes that contribute
to the APOGEE sample, including numerous ancillary science programs, and
we outline the targeting data that will be included in the public data
releases.

The barium abundance was estimated using non-local thermodynamic

the trend of yttrium and barium abundances as a function of distance in

	Abstract = {{Angle-action coordinates are used to study the relic of an N-body
simulation of a self-gravitating satellite galaxy that was released on a
short-period orbit within the disc of the Galaxy. Satellite stars that
lie within 1.5kpc of the Sun are confined to a grid of patches in action
space. As the relic phase mixes for longer, the patches become smaller
and more numerous. These patches can be seen even when the angle-action
coordinates of an erroneous Galactic potential are used, but using the
wrong potential displaces them. Diagnostic quantities constructed from
the angle coordinates both allow the true potential to be identified,
and the relic to be dated. Hence, when the full phase space coordinates
of large numbers of solar-neighbourhood stars are known, it should be
possible to identify members of particular relics from the distribution
of stars in an approximate action space. This would then open up the
possibility of determining the time since the relic was disrupted and
gaining better knowledge of the Galactic potential.

The availability of angle-action coordinates for arbitrary potentials is
the key to these developments. The paper includes a brief introduction
to the torus technique used to generate them.

on the recent significant downward revision of the solar photospheric

result from the use of a 3D hydrodynamic model of the solar atmosphere
instead of the classical 1D hydrostatic models, accounting for
departures from LTE, and improved atomic and molecular data. With these
abundances, the new solar metallicity, Z, decreases to Z=0.012, almost a
factor of two lower than earlier widely used values. We compare our
values with data from other sources and analyse a number of impacts of
these new photospheric abundances. While resolving a number of

also poses serious challenges for the standard solar model as judged by

@article{Spite1982,
	Abstract = {{High resolution spectra with high signal-to-noise ratios (typically 100)
have been obtained for a few halo dwarfs with the 3$^{m}$.6 CFH
telescope. These solar type stars are very old and extremely metal poor.
The Li resonance line ({$\lambda$}6707) is observed, and is essentially
produced by the $^{7}$Li isotope.

Although the mean metal abundance M/H varies from a factor t2 to 250
relative to the Sun, the abundance of lithium is very constant in all
these stars, but the coolest ones where the convection zone is deep
enough to induce $^{7}$Li destruction by proton fusion.

The non-destruction of $^{7}$Li in very old halo stars (of about
the solar type) is to be attributed to the reduction of the size of the
convective zone, reduction caused by the very small abundance of the
heavy elements.

If the problem seems clear for the halo stars it is on the contrary very
confusing in Population I stars. It seems however that in the old disk
stars the destruction of lithium is also inhibited, probably also by a
reduction of the depth of the convective zone due to the slight metal
deficiency. It is pointed out, on the other hand, that among G type
stars of Population I more than a half have a lithium abundance similar
to that of the Hyades, although probably not half of them are as young
as the Hyades.

It is suggested that the destruction of lithium in solar type stars is
sometimes accelerated by the action of another process such as
overshooting or turbulent diffusion, which is not always present.

We admit that the shape of the distribution of Li abundance in the
Pleiades after Duncan (t98 t) rules out a significant destruction of
lithium in the protostellar phase for solar type stars.  Depletion of
Lithium in halo stars by other processes is discussed and found
unlikely. After discussion it is suggested that the abundance of lithium
in halo dwarfs is therefore representative of the abundance of the
interstellar matter which formed the stars and also that this matter
itself retains the lithium abundances of the Big Bang, hardly altered.

We deduce a primordial value of the lithium abundance 11.2
10$^{-11}$ N$_{H}$ (or, by mass X$_{Li}$ = 5.96
10$^{-10}$).

The baryonic density of the Universe deduced from this value is compared
to the densities deduced from the primordial abundance of deuterium and
helium. All these densities are small, and this show that the Universe
cannot be closed by nucleons.

derived from the requirement that FeI and FeII lines should provide the
same iron abundance, shows that such `spectroscopic' gravities are often
in error by a factor of 2 to 3. The importance of the parallax-based

	Abstract = {{In the Milky Way, the thick disk can be defined using individual stellar
abundances, kinematics, or age, or geometrically, as stars high above
the midplane. In nearby galaxies, where only a geometric definition can
be used, thick disks appear to have large radial scale lengths, and
their red colors suggest that they are uniformly old. The Milky
Way{\rsquo}s geometrically thick disk is also radially extended, but it
is far from chemically uniform: {$\alpha$}-enhanced stars are confined
within the inner Galaxy. In simulated galaxies, where old stars are
centrally concentrated, geometrically thick disks are radially extended,
too. Younger stellar populations flare in the simulated disks{\rsquo}
outer regions, bringing those stars high above the midplane. The
resulting geometrically thick disks therefore show a radial age
gradient, from old in their central regions to younger in their
outskirts. Based on our age estimates for a large sample of giant stars
in the APOGEE survey, we can now test this scenario for the Milky Way.
We find that the geometrically defined thick disk in the Milky Way has
indeed a strong radial age gradient: the median age for red clump stars
goes from {\sim}9 Gyr in the inner disk to 5 Gyr in the outer disk. We
propose that at least some nearby galaxies could also have thick disks
that are not uniformly old, and that geometrically thick disks might be
complex structures resulting from different formation mechanisms in
their inner and outer parts.

	Abstract = {{The main goal of Galactic Archaeology is understanding the formation and
evolution of the basic Galactic components. This requires sophisticated
chemo-dynamical modeling, where disc asymmetries (e.g., perturbations
from the central bar, spirals arms, and infalling satellites) and
non-equilibrium processes are taken into account self-consistently. Here
we discuss the current status of Galactic chemo-dynamical modeling and
focus on a recent hybrid technique, which helps circumvent traditional
problems with chemical enrichment and star formation encountered in
fully self-consistent cosmological simulations. We show that this model
can account for a number of chemo-kinematic relations in the Milky Way.
In addition, we demonstrate that (1) our model matches well the observed
age-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] and age-[Fe/H] relations and (2) that the scatter in the
age-[Fe/H] relation cannot be simply explained by blurring (stars on
apo- and pericenters visiting the solar vicinity) but significant radial
migration (stars born elsewhere but ending up at the solar vicinity
today because of a change in guiding radius) is needed. We emphasize the
importance of accurate stellar ages, such as those obtained through
asteroseismology by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, for breaking the
degeneracy among different Galactic evolution scenarios.

	Abstract = {{Observational tests of stellar and Galactic chemical evolution call for
the joint knowledge of a star's physical parameters, detailed element
abundances, and precise age. For cool main-sequence (MS) stars the
abundances of many elements can be measured from spectroscopy, but ages
are very hard to determine. The situation is different if the MS star
has a white dwarf (WD) companion and a known distance, as the age of
such a binary system can then be determined precisely from the
photometric properties of the cooling WD. As a pilot study for obtaining
precise age determinations of field MS stars, we identify nearly one
hundred candidates for such wide binary systems: a faint WD whose GPS1
proper motion matches that of a brighter MS star in Gaia/TGAS with a
good parallax ($\sigma\_\varpi/\varpi\le 0.05$). We model the WD's
multi-band photometry with the BASE-9 code using this precise distance
(assumed to be common for the pair) and infer ages for each binary
system. The resulting age estimates are precise to $\le 10\\%$ ($\le
20\\%$) for $42$ ($67$) MS-WD systems. Our analysis more than doubles the
number of MS-WD systems with precise distances known to date, and it
boosts the number of such systems with precise age determination by an
order of magnitude. With the advent of the Gaia DR2 data, this approach
will be applicable to a far larger sample, providing ages for many MS
stars (that can yield detailed abundances for over 20 elements),
especially in the age range 2 to 8$\backslash$,$\backslash$Gyr, where there are only few known
star clusters.

	Abstract = {{Context: The evolution of C and O abundances in the Milky Way can impose
strong constraints on stellar nucleosynthesis and help in understanding
the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.  <BR />Aims: The aim of this
paper is to review the measured C and O abundances in the disk and bulge
of the Galaxy and compare the results to predictions of Galactic
chemical evolution models.  <BR />Methods: We adopt two successful
chemical evolution models for the bulge and the disk, respectively. They
assume the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions but different histories of
star formation. <BR />Results: The data show a clear distinction between
the trend of [C/O] in the thick and thin Galactic disks, while the thick
disk and bulge trends are indistinguishable with a large ($\gt$0.5 dex)
increase in the [C/O] ratio in the range from -0.1 to +0.4 dex for
[O/H]. In our models we consider yields from massive stars with and
without the inclusion of metallicity-dependent stellar winds. The
observed increase in the [C/O] with metallicity in the bulge and thick
disk lies between the predictions utilizing mass-loss rates of Maeder
and Meynet {\amp} Maeder. A model without metallicity-dependent yields
completely fails to match the observations. Thus, the relative increase
in carbon abundance at high metallicity appears to come from
metallicity-dependent stellar winds in massive stars. These results also
explain the steep decline of the [O/Fe] ratio with [Fe/H] in the
Galactic bulge, while the [Mg/Fe] ratio is enhanced at all [Fe/H].  <BR
/>Conclusions: We conclude that data and models are consistent with a
rapid bulge and thick disk formation timescales, and with
metallicity-dependent yields for C and O. The observed too high [C/O]
ratios at low metallicity in the bulge may stem from an unaccounted
source of carbon: very fast rotating metal poor stars, or metal-poor
binary systems whose envelopes were stripped by Roche lobe overflow.

	Abstract = {{In the first paper of this series, we present a new approach for
studying the chemo-dynamical evolution in disk galaxies, which consists
of fusing disk chemical evolution models with compatible numerical
simulations of galactic disks. This method avoids known star formation
and chemical enrichment problems encountered in simulations. Here we
focus on the Milky Way, by using a detailed thin-disk chemical evolution
model (matching local observables, which are weakly affected by radial
migration) and a simulation in the cosmological context, with dynamical
properties close to those of our Galaxy. We examine in detail the
interplay between in situ chemical enrichment and radial migration and
their impact on key observables in the solar neighborhood, e.g., the
age-metallicity-velocity relation, the metallicity distribution, and
gradients in the radial and vertical directions. We show that, due to
radial migration from mergers at high redshift and the central bar at
later times, a sizable fraction of old metal-poor high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe]
stars can reach the solar vicinity. This naturally accounts for a number
of recent observations related to both the thin and thick disks, despite
the fact that we use thin-disk chemistry only. Although significant
radial mixing is present, the slope in the age-metallicity relation is
only weakly affected, with a scatter compatible with recent
observational work. While we find a smooth density distribution in the
[O/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane, we can recover the observed discontinuity by
selecting particles according to kinematic criteria used in
high-resolution samples to define the thin and thick disks. We outline a
new method for estimating the birth place of the Sun and predict that
the most likely radius lies in the range 4.4 $\lt$ r $\lt$ 7.7 kpc (for a
current location at r = 8 kpc). A new, unifying model for the Milky Way
thick disk is offered, where both mergers and radial migration play a
role at different stages of the disk evolution. We show that in the
absence of early-on massive mergers the vertical velocity dispersion of
the oldest stars is underestimated by a factor of \~{}2 compared with
observations. We can, therefore, argue that the Milky Way thick disk is
unlikely to have been formed through a quiescent disk evolution. An
observational test involving both chemical and kinematic information
must be devised to ascertain this possibility.

	Abstract = {{The frequency of Type I supernovae (SN I) in galaxies with unusual
star-formation activity, as well as the large envelopes of SN I, is
regarded as almost conclusive evidence that the precursors of SN I
belong to a young stellar population. It is assumed that white dwarfs,
SN I, and SN II represent the deaths of stars in the mutually exclusive
mass ranges below 4 solar masses, from 4 to 6.5 solar masses, and above
6.5 solar masses, respectively. Consequences of tentative assumptions
based partly on empirical evidence for iron production by SN I and
carbon production by low-mass stars are tested against published stellar
abundances. From a variety of models for chemical abundances, it is
found that the relative abundances of primary elements are essentially
functions of time, determined by progenitor stellar lifetimes, although
the absolute abundance levels depend mainly on the model parameters.

	Abstract = {{To understand the formation and evolution of solar-type stars in the
solar neighborhood, we need to measure their stellar parameters to high
accuracy. We present a catalogue of accurate stellar parameters for 451
stars that represent the HARPS Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO)
{\ldquo}high precision{\rdquo} sample. Spectroscopic stellar parameters
were measured using high signal-to-noise (S/N) spectra acquired with the
HARPS spectrograph. The spectroscopic analysis was completed assuming
LTE with a grid of Kurucz atmosphere models and the recent ARES code for
measuring line equivalent widths. We show that our results agree well
with those ones presented in the literature (for stars in common). We
present a useful calibration for the effective temperature as a function
of the index color B-V and [Fe/H]. We use our results to study the
metallicity-planet correlation, namely for very low mass planets. The
results presented here suggest that in contrast to their jovian
couterparts, neptune-like planets do not form preferentially around
metal-rich stars. The ratio of jupiter-to-neptunes is also an increasing
function of stellar metallicity. These results are discussed in the
context of the core-accretion model for planet formation.

$^{24}$Mg:$^{25}$Mg:$^{26}$Mg are measured in 32
Hyades dwarfs covering effective temperatures
4000K$\lt$=T$_{eff}$$\lt$=5000K. We find no significant trend in any
isotope ratio versus T$_{eff}$, and the mean isotope ratio is in
excellent agreement with the solar value. We determine stellar
parameters and Fe abundances for 56 Hyades dwarfs covering
4000K$\lt$=T$_{eff}$$\lt$=6200K. For stars warmer than 4700 K, we
derive a cluster mean value of [Fe/H]=0.16+/-0.02 ({$\sigma$}=0.1), in good
agreement with previous studies. For stars cooler than 4700 K, we find
that the abundance of Fe from ionized lines exceeds the abundance of Fe
from neutral lines. At 4700 K,
[Fe/H]$_{II}$-[Fe/H]$_{I}$\~{}=0.3dex, while at 4000 K
[Fe/H]$_{II}$-[Fe/H]$_{I}$\~{}=1.2dex. This discrepancy between
the Fe abundance from neutral and ionized lines likely reflects
inadequacies in the model atmospheres and the presence of non-LTE or
other effects. Despite the inability of the models to reproduce the
ionization equilibrium for Fe, the Mg isotope ratios appear immune to
these problems and remain a powerful tool for studying Galactic chemical
evolution.

high-precision time series photometry for millions of stars with at
least a half-hour cadence. Of particular interest are the circular
regions of 12{\deg} radius centred around the ecliptic poles that will be
observed continuously for a full year. Spectroscopic stellar parameters
are desirable to characterize and select suitable targets for TESS,
whether they are focused on exploring exoplanets, stellar astrophysics
or Galactic archaeology. Here, we present spectroscopic stellar
parameters (T$_{eff}$, log g, [Fe/H], v sin i, v$_{micro}$)
for about 16 000 dwarf and subgiant stars in TESS' southern continuous
viewing zone. For almost all the stars, we also present Bayesian
estimates of stellar properties including distance, extinction, mass,
radius and age using theoretical isochrones. Stellar surface gravity and
radius are made available for an additional set of roughly 8500 red
giants. All our target stars are in the range 10 $\lt$ V $\lt$ 13.1. Among
them, we identify and list 227 stars belonging to the Large Magellanic
Cloud. The data were taken using the High Efficiency and Resolution
Multi-Element Spectrograph (HERMES; R {\sim} 28 000) at the
Anglo-Australian Telescope as part of the TESS-HERMES survey. Comparing
our results with the TESS Input Catalogue (TIC) shows that the TIC is
generally efficient in separating dwarfs and giants, but it has flagged
more than 100 cool dwarfs (T$_{eff}$ $\lt$ 4800 K) as giants, which
ought to be high-priority targets for the exoplanet search. The

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: The nature of the thick disc and its relation to the thin
disc is presently an important subject of debate. In fact, the
structural and chemo-dynamical transition between disc populations can
be used as a test of the proposed models of Galactic disc formation and
evolution. <BR /> Methods: We used the atmospheric parameters,
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundances, and radial velocities, which were determined
from the Gaia-ESO Survey GIRAFFE spectra of FGK-type stars (first nine
months of observations) to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation
of the disc stellar populations. We focussed on a subsample of 1016
stars with high-quality parameters, covering the volume | Z | $\lt$ 4.5
kpc and R in the range 2-13 kpc. <BR /> Results: We have identified a
thin to thick disc separation in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] vs. [M/H] plane,
thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number density
distribution. The thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner
layers above the Galactic plane, as metallicity increases and
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] decreases. In contrast, the thin disc population presents a
constant value of the mean distance to the Galactic plane at all
metallicities. In addition, our data confirm the already known
correlations between V$_{phi}$ and [M/H] for the two discs. For
the thick disc sequence, a study of the possible contamination by thin
disc stars suggests a gradient up to 64 {\plusmn} 9 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$. The distributions of azimuthal velocity, vertical
velocity, and orbital parameters are also analysed for the chemically
separated samples. Concerning the gradients with galactocentric radius,
we find, for the thin disc, a flat behaviour of the azimuthal velocity,
a metallicity gradient equal to -0.058 {\plusmn} 0.008 dex
kpc$^{-1}$ and a very small positive [{$\alpha$}/Fe] gradient. For
the thick disc, flat gradients in [M/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] are derived.
<BR /> Conclusions: Our chemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture
where the thick disc seems to have experienced a settling process,
during which its rotation increased progressively and, possibly, the
azimuthal velocity dispersion decreased. At [M/H] {\ap} -0.25 dex and
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]{\ap} 0.1 dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in
vertical distance to the Galactic plane, rotation, rotational
dispersion, and stellar orbits' eccentricity agree with that of the thin
disc stars of the same metallicity, suggesting a possible connection
between these two populations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.
Finally, the results presented here, based only on the first months of
the Gaia ESO Survey observations, confirm how crucial large
high-resolution spectroscopic surveys outside the solar neighbourhood
are today for our understanding of the Milky Way history.

	Abstract = {{The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST,
also called the Guo Shou Jing Telescope) is a special reflecting Schmidt
telescope. LAMOST's special design allows both a large aperture
(effective aperture of 3.6 m-4.9 m) and a wide field of view (FOV)
(5{\deg}). It has an innovative active reflecting Schmidt configuration
which continuously changes the mirror's surface that adjusts during the
observation process and combines thin deformable mirror active optics
with segmented active optics. Its primary mirror (6.67 m {\times} 6.05 m)
and active Schmidt mirror (5.74m {\times} 4.40m) are both segmented, and
composed of 37 and 24 hexagonal sub-mirrors respectively. By using a
parallel controllable fiber positioning technique, the focal surface of
1.75 m in diameter can accommodate 4000 optical fibers. Also, LAMOST has
16 spectrographs with 32 CCD cameras. LAMOST will be the telescope with
the highest rate of spectral acquisition. As a national large scientific
project, the LAMOST project was formally proposed in 1996, and approved
by the Chinese government in 1997. The construction started in 2001, was
completed in 2008 and passed the official acceptance in June 2009. The
LAMOST pilot survey was started in October 2011 and the spectroscopic
survey will launch in September 2012. Up to now, LAMOST has released
more than 480000 spectra of objects. LAMOST will make an important
contribution to the study of the large-scale structure of the Universe,
structure and evolution of the Galaxy, and cross-identification of
multi-waveband properties in celestial objects.

technique, we are able to derive the averaged three-dimensional velocity
and velocity ellipsoids using only the line-of-sight velocity for the
stars with various effective temperatures within 100$\backslash$lt | z| $\backslash$lt 500 pc.
Using the mean velocities of the cool stars, we derive the solar motion

Moreover, we find that the stars with $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$  $\backslash$gt  6000 K

$\lt$ W$\gt$  compared to the stars with $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$  $\backslash$lt  6000 K.
And their azimuthal velocity increases when | z|  increases. This
peculiar motion in the warmer stars is likely because they are young and
not completely relaxed, although other reasons, such as the resonance
induced by the central rotating bar or the spiral structures and the
perturbation of the merging dwarf galaxies, cannot be ruled out. The
derived velocity dispersions and cross-terms for the data are
approximately consistent with previous studies. We also find that the
vertical gradients of $\{${$\sigma$} $\}$$_{U}$ and $\{${$\sigma$} $\}$$_{V}$
are larger than that of $\{${$\sigma$} $\}$$_{W}$. And the vertical
gradient of $\{${$\sigma$} $\}$$_{U}$ shows a clear correlation with
$\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, while the other two do not. Finally, our sample
shows a vertex deviation of about 11\^{}$\backslash$circ  at 300$\backslash$lt | z| $\backslash$lt 500 pc,

@article{Bland-Hawthorn2017,
	Abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach to calibrating the spectral-spatial response of a wide-field spectrograph using a fibre etalon comb. Conventional wide-field instruments employed on front-line telescopes are mapped with a grid of diffraction-limited holes cut into a focal plane mask. The aberrated grid pattern in the image plane typically reveals n-symmetric (e.g. pincushion) distortion patterns over the field arising from the optical train. This approach is impractical in the presence of a dispersing element because the diffraction-limited spots in the focal plane are imaged as an array of overlapping spectra. Instead, we propose a compact solution that builds on recent developments in fibre-based, Fabry-Perot etalons. We introduce a novel approach to near-field illumination that exploits a 20cm aperture commercial telescope and the propagation of skew rays in a multimode fibre. The mapping of the optical transfer function across the full field is represented accurately ({\textless}0.5{\%} rms residual) by an orthonormal set of Chebyshev moments. Thus we are able to reconstruct the full 4K x 4K CCD image of the dispersed output from the optical fibres using this mapping, as we demonstrate. Our method targets one of the largest sources of systematic error in multi-object spectroscopy, i.e. spectral distortion due to instrumental aberrations, and provides a comprehensive solution to their calibration and removal.},

@article{Lewis2002,
	Abstract = {{The 2dF (Two-degree Field) facility at the prime focus of the
Anglo-Australian Telescope provides multiple-object spectroscopy over a
2{\deg} field of view. Up to 400 target fibres can be independently
positioned by a complex robot. Two spectrographs provide spectra with
resolutions of between 500 and 2000, over wavelength ranges of 440 and
110nm respectively. The 2dF facility began routine observations in 1997.
2dF was designed primarily for galaxy redshift surveys and has a number
of innovative features. The large corrector lens incorporates an
atmospheric dispersion compensator, essential for wide wavelength
coverage with small-diameter fibres. The instrument has two full sets of
fibres on separate field plates, so that re-configuring can be done in
parallel with observing. The robot positioner places one fibre every 6s,
to a precision of 0.3arcsec (20{$\mu$}m) over the full field. All
components of 2dF, including the spectrographs, are mounted on a 5-m
diameter telescope top end ring for ease of handling and to keep the
optical fibres short in order to maximize UV throughput. There is a
pipeline data reduction system which allows each data set to be fully
analysed while the next field is being observed. 2dF has achieved its
initial astronomical goals. The redshift surveys obtain spectra at the
rate of 2500 galaxies per night, yielding a total of about 200000
objects in the first four years. Typically a B=19 galaxy gives a
spectrum with a signal-to-noise ratio of better than 10 per pixel in
less than an hour; redshifts are derived for about 95 per cent of all
galaxies, with 99 per cent reliability or better. Total system
throughput is about 5 per cent. The failure rate of the positioner and
fibre system is about 1:10000 moves or once every few nights, and

	Abstract = {{Multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) instruments, such as the Two-degree
Field (2dF) facility of the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO), have
facilitated large-scale redshift surveys. Yet despite their acclaim,
instrument design has been suspected of introducing subtle selection
effects into surveys. Investigation into these selection effects has
been overshadowed by instrument complexity. We identify the field
configuration algorithm (FCA) used to select targets for observation as
mainly responsible for such effects. An FCA can imprint artificial
structure on observed target distributions, which may accrue over large
angular scales, potentially to the detriment of statistical analyses
applied to such surveys. We present here a new FCA developed for 2dF
that is based on simulated annealing (SA), a generic method commonly
used to solve constrained optimization problems. We generate synthetic
fields and utilize mock 2dF volumes to contrast the behaviour of
previous strategies with the SA FCA. The angular two-point correlation
function and other sensitive techniques reveal that the new FCA achieves
unprecedented sampling uniformity and target yield with improved target
priority handling and observational flexibility over current FCAs. The
SA FCA is generic enough to be used by current 2dF-like and potentially
next-generation MOS instruments with little modification.

	Abstract = {We present a new technique called "{t-SNE}" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. {t-SNE} is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how {t-SNE} can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of {t-SNE} on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by {t-SNE} are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

@article{Haywood2008b,
	Abstract = {{The analysis of the kinematics of solar neighbourhood stars shows that
the low- and high-metallicity tails of the thin disc are populated by
objects which orbital properties suggest an origin in the outer and
inner Galactic disc, respectively. Signatures of radial migration are
identified in various recent samples, and are shown to be responsible
for the high-metallicity dispersion in the age-metallicity distribution.
Most importantly, it is shown that the population of low-metallicity
wanderers of the thin disc (-0.7 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.3 dex) is also
responsible for the apparent hiatus in metallicity with the thick disc
(which terminal metallicity is about -0.2 dex). It implies that the thin
disc at the solar circle has started to form stars at about this same
metallicity. This is also consistent with the fact that `transition'
objects, which have {$\alpha$}-element abundance intermediate between that
of the thick and thin discs, are found in the range [-0.4, -0.2] dex.
Once the metal-poor thin disc stars are recognized for what they are -
wanderers from the outer thin disc - the parenthood between the two
discs can be identified on stars genuinely formed at the solar circle
through an evolutionary sequence in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H]. Another
consequence is that stars that can be considered as truly resulting of
the chemical evolution at the solar circle have a metallicity restricted
to about [-0.2, +0.2] dex, confirming an old idea that most chemical
evolution in the Milky Way have preceded the thin disc formation.

@article{Adibekyan2013,
	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We analyzed chemical and kinematical properties of about
850 FGK solar neighborhood long-lived dwarfs observed with the HARPS
high-resolution spectrograph. The stars in the sample have log g {\ge} 4
dex, 5000 {\le} T$_{eff}$ {\le} 6500 K, and - 1.39 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le}
0.55 dex. The aim of this study is to characterize and explore the
kinematics and chemical properties of stellar populations of the Galaxy
in order to understand their origins and evolution. <BR /> Methods: We
applied a purely chemical analysis approach based on the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
vs. [Fe/H] plot to separate Galactic stellar populations into the thin
disk, thick disk, and high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich (h{$\alpha$}mr). Then, we
explored the population's stellar orbital eccentricity distributions,
their correlation with metallicity, and rotational velocity gradients
with metallicity in the Galactic disks to provide constraints on the
various formation models. <BR /> Results: We identified a gap in the
[{$\alpha$}/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane for the {$\alpha$}-enhanced stars, and by
performing a bootstrapped Monte Carlo test we obtained a probability
higher than 99.99\% that this gap is not due to small-number statistics.
Our analysis shows a negative gradient of the rotational velocity of the
thin disk stars with [Fe/H] (-17 km s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$),
and a steep positive gradient for both the thick disk and h{$\alpha$}mr
stars with the same magnitude of about +42 km s$^{-1}$
dex$^{-1}$. For the thin disk stars we observed no correlation
between orbital eccentricities and metallicity, but observed a steep
negative gradient for the thick disk and h{$\alpha$}mr stars with
practically the same magnitude ({\ap}-0.18 dex$^{-1}$). The
correlations observed for the nearby stars (on average 45 pc) using
high-precision data, in general agree well with the results obtained for
the SDSS sample of stars located farther from the Galactic plane. <BR />
Conclusions: Our results suggest that radial migration played an
important role in the formation and evolution of the thin disk. For the
thick disk stars it is not possible to reach a firm conclusion about
their origin. Based on the eccentricity distribution of the thick disk
stars only their accretion origin can be ruled out, and the heating and
migration scenario could explain the positive steep gradient of
V$_{phi}$ with [Fe/H]. When we analyzed the h{$\alpha$}mr stellar
population we found that they share properties of both the thin and
thick disk population. A comparison of the properties of the h{$\alpha$}mr
stars with those of the subsample of stars from the N-body/SPH
simulation using radial migration suggest that they may have originated
from the inner Galaxy. Further detailed investigations would help to
clarify their exact nature and origin.

decreasing age for a large sample of Galactic open clusters. The
observed pattern of [Ba/Fe] versus age can be reproduced with a Galactic

parameterized models of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis. We show that
this is possible in a scenario where the efficiency of the extra-mixing
processes producing the neutron source $^{13}$C is anticorrelated

is similar to the known trend of extended mixing episodes acting in
H-rich layers and might suggest a common physical mechanism.

	Abstract = {{In a recent study based on homogeneous barium abundance measurements in
open clusters (OCs), a trend of increasing [Ba/Fe] ratios for decreasing
cluster age was reported. We present here further abundance
determinations, relative to four other elements having important
s-process contributions, with the aim of investigating whether or not
the growth found for [Ba/Fe] is indicative of a general property, shared
also by the other heavy elements formed by slow neutron captures. In
particular, we derived abundances for yttrium, zirconium, lanthanum, and
cerium, using equivalent width measurements and the MOOG code. Our
sample includes 19 OCs of different ages, for which the spectra were
obtained by the ESO Very Large Telescope using the UVES spectrometer.
The growth previously suggested for Ba is confirmed for all the elements
analyzed in our study. This fact implies significant changes in our
views of the Galactic chemical evolution for elements beyond iron. Our
results necessarily require that very low mass asymptotic giant branch
stars (Mlap1.5 M $_{sun}$) produce larger amounts of s-process
elements (and hence activate the $^{13}$C-neutron source more
effectively) than previously expected. Their role in producing
neutron-rich elements in the Galactic disk has been so far
underestimated, and their evolution and neutron-capture nucleosynthesis

	Abstract = {{In this paper we follow the Galactic enrichment of three easily observed
light n-capture elements: Sr, Y, and Zr. Input stellar yields have been
first separated into their respective main and weak s-process components
and r-process component. The s-process yields from asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars of low to intermediate mass are computed, exploring a
wide range of efficiencies of the major neutron source, $^{13}$C,
and covering both disk and halo metallicities. AGB stars have been shown
to reproduce the main s-component in the solar system, i.e., the
s-process isotopic distribution of all heavy isotopes with atomic mass
number A$\gt$90, with a minor contribution to the light s-process
isotopes up to A\~{}90. The concurrent weak s-process, which accounts for
the major fraction of the light s-process isotopes in the solar system
and occurs in massive stars by the operation of the $^{22}$Ne
neutron source, is discussed in detail. Neither the main s- nor the weak
s-components are shown to contribute significantly to the
neutron-capture element abundances observed in unevolved halo stars.
Knowing the s-process distribution at the epoch of the solar system
formation, we first employed the r-process residuals method to infer the
isotopic distribution of the r-process. We assumed a primary r-process
production in the Galaxy from moderately massive Type II supernovae that
best reproduces the observational Galactic trend of metallicity versus
Eu, an almost pure r-process element. We present a detailed analysis of
a large published database of spectroscopic observations of Sr, Y, Zr,
Ba, and Eu for Galactic stars at various metallicities, showing that the
observed trends versus metallicity can be understood in light of a
multiplicity of stellar neutron-capture components. Spectroscopic
observations of the Sr, Y, and Zr to Ba and Eu abundance ratios versus
metallicity provide useful diagnostics of the types of neutron-capture
processes forming Sr, Y, and Zr. In particular, the observed [Sr, Y,
Zr/Ba, Eu] ratio is clearly not flat at low metallicities, as we would
expect if Ba, Eu and Sr, Y, Zr all had the same r-process
nucleosynthetic origin. We discuss our chemical evolution predictions,
taking into account the interplay between different processes to produce
Sr-Y-Zr. Making use of the very r-process-rich and very metal-poor stars
like CS 22892-052 and CS 31082-001, we find hints and discuss the
possibility of a primary process in low-metallicity massive stars,
different from the ``classical s-process'' and from the ``classical
r-process'' that we tentatively define LEPP (lighter element primary
process). This allows us to revise the estimates of the r-process
contributions to the solar Sr, Y, and Zr abundances, as well as of the
contribution to the s-only isotopes $^{86}$Sr, $^{87}$Sr,
and $^{96}$Mo.

	Abstract = {{For the first time, we present an extensive study of stars with
individual non-LTE (NLTE) abundances for 17 chemical elements from Li to
Eu in a sample of stars uniformly distributed over the -2.62 {\le} [Fe/H]
{\le} +0.24 metallicity range that is suitable for the Galactic chemical
evolution research. The star sample has been kinematically selected to
trace the Galactic thin and thick disks and halo. We find new results
and improve earlier ones as follows: (I) the element-to-iron ratios for
Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti form a metal-poor (MP) plateau at a similar height of
0.3 dex, and the knee occurs at common [Fe/H] {\sime} -0.8. The knee at
the same metallicity is observed for [O/Fe], and the MP plateau is
formed at [O/Fe] = 0.61. (II) The upward trend of [C/O] with decreasing
metallicity exists at [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.2, supporting the earlier finding
of Akerman et al. (III) An underabundance of Na relative to Mg in the
[Fe/H] $\lt$ -1 stars is nearly constant, with the mean [Na/ Mg] {\sime}
-0.5. (IV) The K/Sc, Ca/Sc, and Ti/Sc ratios form well-defined trends,
suggesting a common site of the K-Ti production. (v) Sr follows the Fe
abundance down to [Fe/H] {\sime} -2.5, while Zr is enhanced in MP stars.
(VI) The comparisons of our results with some widely used Galactic
evolution models are given. The use of the NLTE element abundances gives
increased credit to the interpretation of the data in the context of the
chemical evolution of the Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: LTE abundances of light elements in extremely metal-poor
(EMP) stars have been previously derived from high quality spectra. New
derivations, free from the NLTE effects, will better constrain the
models of the Galactic chemical evolution and the yields of the very
first supernovae. <BR /> Methods: The NLTE profiles of the magnesium and
potassium lines have been computed in a sample of 53 extremely
metal-poor stars with a modified version of the program MULTI and
adjusted to the observed lines in order to derive the abundances of
these elements. <BR /> Results: The NLTE corrections for magnesium and
potassium are in good agreement with the works found in the literature.
The abundances are slightly changed, reaching a better precision: the
scatter around the mean of the abundance ratios has decreased. Magnesium
may be used with confidence as reference element. Together with
previously determined NLTE abundances of sodium and aluminum, the new
ratios are displayed, for comparison, along the theoretical trends
proposed by some models of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, using
different models of supernovae.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We want to determine the lithium abundances of solar twin
stars as a function of stellar age to provide constraints for stellar
evolutions models and to investigate whether there is a connection
between low Li abundance and the occurrence of planets. <BR /> Methods:
For a sample of 21 solar twins observed with the HARPS spectrograph at
high spectral resolution (R {\sime} 115.000) and very high
signal-to-noise ratio (600 {\le} S/N {\le} 2400), precise lithium
abundances were obtained by spectral synthesis of the Li I 6707.8
{\AA} line and compared to stellar ages, masses, and metallicities
determined from a spectroscopic analysis of the same set of HARPS
spectra. <BR /> Results: We show that for the large majority of the
solar twins there is a strong correlation between lithium abundance and
stellar age. As the age increases from 1 to 9 Gyr, the Li abundance
decreases by a factor of \~{}50. The relation agrees fairly well with
predictions from non-standard stellar evolution models of Li destruction
at the bottom of the upper convection zone. Two stars deviate from the
relation by having Li abundances enhanced by a factor of \~{}10, which may
be due to planet engulfment. On the other hand, we find no indication of
a link between planet hosting stars and enhanced lithium depletion.

	Abstract = {{The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is a three-year survey that is
collecting 10$^{5}$ high-resolution spectra in the near-IR across
multiple Galactic populations. To derive stellar parameters and chemical
compositions from this massive data set, the APOGEE Stellar Parameters
and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) has been developed. Here, we
describe empirical calibrations of stellar parameters presented in the
first SDSS-III APOGEE data release (DR10). These calibrations were
enabled by observations of 559 stars in 20 globular and open clusters.
The cluster observations were supplemented by observations of stars in
NASA's Kepler field that have well determined surface gravities from
asteroseismic analysis. We discuss the accuracy and precision of the
derived stellar parameters, considering especially effective
temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity; we also briefly discuss
the derived results for the abundances of the {$\alpha$}-elements, carbon,
and nitrogen. Overall, we find that ASPCAP achieves reasonably accurate
results for temperature and metallicity, but suffers from systematic
errors in surface gravity. We derive calibration relations that bring
the raw ASPCAP results into better agreement with independently
determined stellar parameters. The internal scatter of ASPCAP parameters
within clusters suggests that metallicities are measured with a
precision better than 0.1 dex, effective temperatures better than 150 K,
and surface gravities better than 0.2 dex. The understanding provided by
the clusters and Kepler giants on the current accuracy and precision
will be invaluable for future improvements of the pipeline.

	Abstract = {{Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) lie to the red of the main sequence and
fainter than the red giant branch in cluster color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs), a region not easily populated by standard stellar
evolution pathways. While there has been speculation on what mechanisms
may create these unusual stars, no well-developed theory exists to
explain their origins. Here we discuss three hypotheses of SSG
formation: (1) mass transfer in a binary system, (2) stripping of a
subgiant{\rsquo}s envelope, perhaps during a dynamical encounter, and (3)
reduced luminosity due to magnetic fields that lower convective
efficiency and produce large starspots. Using the stellar evolution code
MESA, we develop evolutionary tracks for each of these hypotheses, and
compare the expected stellar and orbital properties of these models with
six known SSGs in the two open clusters M67 and NGC 6791. All three of
these mechanisms can create stars or binary systems in the SSG CMD
domain. We also calculate the frequency with which each of these
mechanisms may create SSG systems, and find that the magnetic field
hypothesis is expected to create SSGs with the highest frequency in open
clusters. Mass transfer and envelope stripping have lower expected
formation frequencies, but may nevertheless create occasional SSGs in
open clusters. They may also be important mechanisms to create SSGs in
higher mass globular clusters.

	Abstract = {{We have determined abundances of copper, zinc, sodium, and aluminum in
the atmospheres of 172 F, G, and K dwarf stars (-1.0 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$
0.3) belonging to the Galaxy's thin and thick disks and to the Hercules
moving group. Our observations were performed with the ELODIE
{\'e}chelle spectrometer on the 1.93-m telescope of the Haute
Provence Observatory, with a resolving power of R = 42 000 and
signal-to-noise ratio S/N $\gt$ 100. The Na, Al, Cu, and Zn abundances
were derived in an LTE approximation; the synthetic spectrum for the
copper lines was calculated taking into account super-fine structure of
the lines. We analyzed the abundances of these elements as a function of
metallicity [Fe/H] for stars of the thin and thick disks of the Galaxy
and the Hercules moving group. The Cu abundances and their trends with
metallicity are essentially the same in the three studied
sub-structures. The mean Al and Zn abundances for stars of the thin and
thick disks differ significantly.

	Abstract = {{We examine the chemical and dynamical structure in the solar
neighbourhood of a model Galaxy that is the endpoint of a simulation of
the chemical evolution of the Milky Way in the presence of radial mixing
of stars and gas. Although the simulation's star formation rate declines
monotonically from its unique peak and no merger or tidal event ever
takes place, the model replicates all known properties of a thick disc,
as well as matching special features of the local stellar population
such as a metal-poor extension of the thin disc that has high rotational
velocity. We divide the disc by chemistry and relate this dissection to
observationally more convenient kinematic selection criteria. We
conclude that the observed chemistry of the Galactic disc does not
provide convincing evidence for a violent origin of the thick disc, as
has been widely claimed.

	Abstract = {{Context. Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) contains astrometric results for more
than 1 billion stars brighter than magnitude 20.7 based on observations
collected by the Gaia satellite during the first 14 months of its
operational phase. <BR /> Aims: We give a brief overview of the
astrometric content of the data release and of the model assumptions,
data processing, and validation of the results. <BR /> Methods: For
stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues, complete
astrometric single-star solutions are obtained by incorporating
positional information from the earlier catalogues. For other stars only
their positions are obtained, essentially by neglecting their proper
motions and parallaxes. The results are validated by an analysis of the
residuals, through special validation runs, and by comparison with
external data. <BR /> Results: For about two million of the brighter
stars (down to magnitude  11.5) we obtain positions, parallaxes, and
proper motions to Hipparcos-type precision or better. For these stars,
systematic errors depending for example on position and colour are at a
level of {\plusmn} 0.3 milliarcsecond (mas). For the remaining stars we
obtain positions at epoch J2015.0 accurate to  10 mas. Positions and
proper motions are given in a reference frame that is aligned with the
International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to better than 0.1 mas at
epoch J2015.0, and non-rotating with respect to ICRF to within 0.03 mas
yr$^{-1}$. The Hipparcos reference frame is found to rotate with
respect to the Gaia DR1 frame at a rate of 0.24 mas yr$^{-1}$. <BR /> Conclusions: Based on less than a quarter of the nominal mission
length and on very provisional and incomplete calibrations, the quality
and completeness of the astrometric data in Gaia DR1 are far from what
is expected for the final mission products. The present results
nevertheless represent a huge improvement in the available fundamental
stellar data and practical definition of the optical reference frame.

contribution from Type Ia supernovae. The disk formed with a constant
star formation over 13 Gyr, and shows a decreasing trend of [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
and increasing trends of [(Na,Al,Cu,Mn)/Fe] against [Fe/H]. However, the
thick disk stars tend to have higher [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and lower [Mn/Fe] than
thin disk stars. We also predict the frequency distribution of elemental

directly compared with galactic archeology projects such as HERMES.

	Abstract = {{Isotope ratios have opened a new window into the study of the details of
stellar evolution, supernovae and galactic chemical evolution. We
present the evolution of the isotope ratios of elemental abundances
(from C to Zn) in the solar neighbourhood, bulge, halo and thick disc,
using chemical evolution models with updated yields of asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars and core-collapse supernovae. The evolutionary
history of each element is different owing to the effects of the initial
progenitor mass and metallicity on element production. In the bulge and
thick disc the star formation time-scale is shorter than in the solar
neighbourhood, leading to higher [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios. Likewise, the
smaller contribution from Type Ia supernovae in these regions leads to
lower [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P,
Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity
on element production from core-collapse supernovae. According to our
predictions, it is possible to find metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] {\gsim}-1)
that formed in the early Universe as a result of rapid star formation.
The chemical enrichment time-scale of the halo is longer than in the
solar neighbourhood, and consequently the ratios of [(C, F)/Fe] and
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C are higher owing to a significant
contribution from low-mass AGB stars. While the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Mn/Fe]
ratios are the same as in the solar neighbourhood, the [(Na, Al, P, Cl,
K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] ratios are predicted to be lower. Furthermore, we
predict that isotope ratios such as $^{24}$Mg/$^{25, 26}$Mg
are larger because of the contribution from low-metallicity supernovae.
Using isotopic ratios, it is possible to select stars that formed in a
system with a low chemical enrichment efficiency such as the satellite
galaxies that were accreted on to our own Milky Way Galaxy.

	Abstract = {{Gaia and its complementary spectroscopic surveys combined will yield the
most comprehensive database of kinematic and chemical information of
stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia FGK benchmark stars play a central role
in this matter as they are calibration pillars for the atmospheric
parameters and chemical abundances for various surveys. The
spectroscopic analyses of the benchmark stars are done by combining
different methods, and the results will be affected by the systematic
uncertainties inherent in each method. In this paper, we explore some of
these systematic uncertainties. We determined line abundances of Ca, Cr,
Mn and Co for four benchmark stars using six different methods. We
changed the default input parameters of the different codes in a
systematic way and found, in some cases, significant differences between
the results. Since there is no consensus on the correct values for many
of these default parameters, we urge the community to raise discussions
towards standard input parameters that could alleviate the difference in
abundances obtained by different methods. In this work, we provide
quantitative estimates of uncertainties in elemental abundances due to
the effect of differing technical assumptions in spectrum modelling.

	Abstract = {{Context. Due to their volatile nature, when sulphur and zinc are
observed in external galaxies, their determined abundances represent the
gas-phase abundances in the interstellar medium. This implies that they
can be used as tracers of the chemical enrichment of matter in the
Universe at high redshift. Comparable observations in stars are more
difficult and, until recently, plagued by small number statistics. <BR
/> Aims: We wish to exploit the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) data to study the
behaviour of sulphur and zinc abundances of a large number of Galactic
stars, in a homogeneous way. <BR /> Methods: By using the UVES spectra
of the GES sample, we are able to assemble a sample of 1301 Galactic
stars, including stars in open and globular clusters in which both
sulphur and zinc were measured. <BR /> Results: We confirm the results
from the literature that sulphur behaves as an {$\alpha$}-element. We find
a large scatter in [Zn/Fe] ratios among giant stars around solar
metallicity. The lower ratios are observed in giant stars at
Galactocentric distances less than 7.5 kpc. No such effect is observed
among dwarf stars, since they do not extend to that radius. <BR />
Conclusions: Given the sample selection, giants and dwarfs are observed
at different Galactic locations, and it is plausible, and compatible
with simple calculations, that Zn-poor giants trace a younger population
more polluted by SN Ia yields. It is necessary to extend observations in
order to observe both giants and dwarfs at the same Galactic location.
Further theoretical work on the evolution of zinc is also necessary.

	Abstract = {{We present a uniform study of the chemical abundances of 12 elements
(Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Na, Mg, and Al) derived from the
spectra of 451 stars observed as part of one of the HARPS GTO planet
search programs. Sixty eight of these are planet-bearing stars. The main
goals of our work are: i) the investigation of possible differences
between the abundances of stars with and without planets; ii) the study
of the possible differences in the abundances of stars in the thin and
the thick disc. We confirm that there is a systematically higher
metallicity in planet host stars, when compared to non planet-hosts,
common to all studied species. We also found that there is no difference
in the galactic chemical evolution trends of the stars with and without
planets. Stars that harbour planetary companions simply appear to be in
the high metallicity tail of the distribution. We also confirm that
Neptunian and super-Earth class planets may be easier to find at lower
metallicities. A statistically significative abundance difference
between stars of the thin and the thick disc was found for [ Fe/H] $\lt$
0. However, the populations from the thick and the thin disc cannot be
clearly separated.

	Abstract = {{We present a new basis for scaling abundances with total metallicity in
nebular photoionization models, based on extensive Milky Way stellar
abundance data, to replace the uniform scaling normally used in the
analysis of H II regions. Our goal is to provide a single scaling method
and local abundance reference standard for use in nebular modelling and
its key inputs, the stellar atmosphere and evolutionary track models. We
introduce a parametric enrichment factor, {$\zeta$}, to describe how atomic
abundances scale with total abundance, which allows for a simple
conversion between scales based on different reference elements (usually
oxygen or iron). The models and parametric description provide a more
physically realistic approach than simple uniform abundance scaling.
With appropriate parameters, the methods described here may be applied
to H II regions in the Milky Way, large and dwarf galaxies in the local
Universe, active galactic nuclei, and to star-forming regions at high
redshift.

	Abstract = {{We revisit the Galactic chemical evolution of oxygen, addressing the
systematic errors inherent in classical determinations of the oxygen
abundance that arise from the use of one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic
model atmospheres and from the assumption of local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE). We perform detailed 3D non-LTE radiative-transfer
calculations for atomic oxygen lines across a grid of 3D hydrodynamic
STAGGER model atmospheres for dwarfs and subgiants. We apply our grid of
predicted line strengths of the [O I] 630 nm and O I 777 nm lines using
accurate stellar parameters from the literature. We infer a steep decay
in [O/Fe] for [Fe/H] {\gsim} -1.0, a plateau [O/Fe] {\ap} 0.5 down to
[Fe/H] {\ap} -2.5, and an increasing trend for [Fe/H] {\lsim} -2.5. Our 3D
non-LTE calculations yield overall concordant results from the two
oxygen abundance diagnostics.

@article{Hawkins2016b,
	Abstract = {{Context. The APOGEE survey has obtained high-resolution infrared spectra
of more than 100 000 stars. Deriving chemical abundances patterns of
these stars is paramount to piecing together the structure of the Milky
Way. While the derived chemical abundances have been shown to be precise
for most stars, some calibration problems have been reported, in
particular for more metal-poor stars. <BR /> Aims: In this paper, we aim
to (1) re-determine the chemical abundances of the APOGEE+Kepler stellar
sample (APOKASC) with an independent procedure, line list and line
selection, and high-quality surface gravity information from
asteroseismology; and (2) extend the abundance catalogue by including
abundances that are not currently reported in the most recent APOGEE
release (DR12). <BR /> Methods: We fixed the T$_{eff}$ and log g
to those determined using spectrophotometric and asteroseismic
techniques, respectively. We made use of the Brussels Automatic Stellar
Parameter (BACCHUS) code to derive the metallicity and broadening
parameters for the APOKASC sample. In addition, we derived differential
abundances with respect to Arcturus. <BR /> Results: We have validated
the BACCHUS code on APOGEE data using several well-known stars, and
stars from open and globular clusters. We also provide the abundances of
C, N, O, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S, Al, Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, K, and V for every star
and line, and show the impact of line selection on the final abundances.
Improvements have been made for some elements (e.g. Ti, Si, V).
Additionally, we measure new abundance ratios not found in the current
APOGEE release including P, Cu, Rb, and Yb, which are only upper limits
at this time, as well as Co and Cr which are promising. <BR />
Conclusions: In this paper, we present an independent analysis of the
APOKASC sample and provide abundances of up to 21 elements. This
catalogue can be used not only to study chemical abundance patterns of
the Galaxy but also to train data driven spectral approaches which can
improve the abundance precision in a restricted dataset, but also full
APOGEE sample.

	Abstract = {{The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began
observations in 2014 July. It pursues three core programs: the Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2), Mapping
Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA), and the Extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). As well as its core program, eBOSS
contains two major subprograms: the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey
(TDSS) and the SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Sources
(SPIDERS). This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV,
Data Release 13 (DR13). DR13 makes publicly available the first 1390
spatially resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies
from MaNGA. It includes new observations from eBOSS, completing the
Sloan Extended QUasar, Emission-line galaxy, Luminous red galaxy Survey
(SEQUELS), which also targeted variability-selected objects and
X-ray-selected objects. DR13 includes new reductions of the SDSS-III
BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift
classification, and new reductions of the SDSS-III APOGEE-1 data,
improving stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. DR13
provides more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Value-added
target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS and an updated
red-clump catalog for APOGEE are also available. This paper describes
the location and format of the data and provides references to important
technical papers. The SDSS web site, <A
href=``http://www.sdss.org''>http://www.sdss.org</A>, provides links to
the data, tutorials, examples of data access, and extensive
documentation of the reduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the
first of a scheduled set that will contain new data and analyses from
the planned {\sim}6 yr operations of SDSS-IV.

with atypically large lithium abundances. Using moderate-resolution
spectra taken as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, along with
high-resolution followup spectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope,
we identify 23 post-turnoff stars with log {$\epsilon$}(Li) greater than
1.95, including 14 with log {$\epsilon$}(Li) {\ge} 2.3 and 8 with log
{$\epsilon$}(Li) {\ge} 3.0, well above the low level expected for evolved
stars. Comparison with theoretical isochrones indicates that some of our
Li-rich stars are affiliated with the upper red giant branch, the
asymptotic giant branch and the red clump rather than the RGB bump,
which is a challenge to existing models of Li production in evolved
stars.

	Abstract = {{To understand the formation and evolution of solar-type stars and
planets in the solar neighborhood, we need to obtain their stellar
parameters with high precision. We present a catalog of precise stellar
parameters for low-activity FGK single stars in a volume-limited sample
followed by the HARPS spectrograph in the quest to identify extra-solar
planets. The spectroscopic analysis was completed assuming LTE with a
grid of Kurucz atmosphere models and using the ARES code to perform an
automatic measurement of the line equivalent widths. The results are
compared with different independent methods and also with other values
found in the literature for common stars. Both comparisons are
consistent and illustrate the homogeneity of the parameters derived by
our team. The derived metallicities of this sample reveal a somewhat
different distribution for the present planet hosts, but still indicates
the already known higher frequency of planets observed for the more
metal-rich stars. We combine the results derived in this sample with the
one from the CORALIE survey to present the largest homogeneous
spectroscopic study of the metallicity-giant-planet relation using a
total of 1830 stars.

	Abstract = {{We present a re-analysis of the Geneva-Copenhagen survey, which benefits
from the infrared flux method to improve the accuracy of the derived
stellar effective temperatures and uses the latter to build a consistent
and improved metallicity scale. Metallicities are calibrated on
high-resolution spectroscopy and checked against four open clusters and
a moving group, showing excellent consistency. The new temperature and
metallicity scales provide a better match to theoretical isochrones,
which are used for a Bayesian analysis of stellar ages. With respect to
previous analyses, our stars are on average 100 K hotter and 0.1 dex
more metal rich, which shift the peak of the metallicity distribution
function around the solar value. From Str{\"o}mgren photometry we are
able to derive for the first time a proxy for [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundances,
which enables us to perform a tentative dissection of the chemical thin
and thick disc. We find evidence for the latter being composed of an
old, mildly but systematically alpha-enhanced population that extends to
super solar metallicities, in agreement with spectroscopic studies. Our
revision offers the largest existing kinematically unbiased sample of
the solar neighbourhood that contains full information on kinematics,
metallicities, and ages and thus provides better constraints on the
physical processes relevant in the build-up of the Milky Way disc,
enabling a better understanding of the Sun in a Galactic context.

about 12,500 stars brighter than I = 18.0 towards the South Galactic
Pole, allowing the stellar luminosity function in absolute visual
magnitude, bolometric magnitude, and mass in the solar neighborhood for
all absolute magnitudes above the thermonuclear burning limit, to be
derived. Also obtained are the density laws with distance from the
Galactic plane for each absolute magnitude. The 300 pc scale height
component is identified as an old disk, and the 1350 pc scale height
component as a Galactic 'thick disk'. The luminosity function and
density law of the thick disk are consistent with a substantial
flattening of the spheroid isodensity contours by the gravitational
potential of the Galactic disk, in agreement with recent observations of
several external galaxies.

	Abstract = {{We have performed an abundance analysis for F- and G- dwarfs of the
Galactic thick-disc component. A sample of 176 nearby (d$\lt$= 150pc)
thick-disc candidate stars was chosen from the Hipparcos catalogue and
subjected to a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis. Using accurate
radial velocities combined with the Hipparcos astrometry, kinematics (U,
V and W) and Galactic orbital parameters were computed. We estimate the
probability for a star to belong to the thin disc, the thick disc or the
halo. With a probability P$\gt$= 70 per cent taken as certain membership,
we assigned 95 stars to the thick disc, 13 to the thin disc, and 20 to
the halo. The remaining 48 stars in the sample cannot be assigned with
reasonable certainty to one of the three components.

Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, Ce, Nd and Eu have been obtained. The abundances for the
thick-disc stars are compared with those for the thin-disc members from
Reddy et al. The ratios of {$\alpha$}-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti) to
iron for thick-disc stars show a clear enhancement compared to thin-disc
members in the range -0.3 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.2. There are also other
elements - Al, Sc, V, Co, and possibly Zn - which show enhanced ratios
to iron in the thick disc relative to the thin disc. The abundances of
Na, Cr, Mn, Ni and Cu (relative to Fe) are very similar for thin- and
thick-disc stars. The dispersion in abundance ratios [X/Fe] at given
[Fe/H] for thick-disc stars is consistent with the expected scatter due
to measurement errors, suggesting a lack of `cosmic' scatter.

A few stars classified as members of the thick disc by our kinematic
criteria show thin-disc abundances. These stars, which appear older than
most thin-disc stars, are also, on average, younger than the thick-disc
population. They may have originated early in the thin-disc history, and
been subsequently scattered to hotter orbits by collisions. The thick
disc may not include stars with [Fe/H] $\gt$ -0.3. The observed
compositions of the thin and thick discs seem to be consistent with the
models of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering in a Lambda cold
dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) universe.

	Abstract = {{Stars with planets at intermediate metallicities ([-0.7, -0.2] dex)
exhibit properties that differ from the general field stars. Thirteen
stars with planets reported in this metallicity range belong to the
thick disc, while only one planet have been detected among stars of the
thin disc. Although this statistics is weak, it contradicts the known
correlation between the presence of planet and metallicity. We relate
this finding to the specific property of the thin disc in this
metallicity range, where stars are shown to rotate around the Galaxy
faster than the Sun. Their orbital parameters are conveniently explained
if they are contaminants coming from the outer Galactic disc, as a
result of radial mixing. This must be considered together with the fact
that metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]$\gt$+0.1 dex) found in the solar
neighbourhood, which are the hosts of most of the detected planets, are
suspected of being wanderers from the inner Galactic disc. It is then
questionned why stars that originate in the inner and outer thin disc
show respectively the highest and lowest rate of detected planets. It is
suggested that the presence of giant planets might be primarily a
function of a parameter linked to galactocentric radius, but not
metallicity. Combined with the existing radial metallicity gradient,
then radial mixing explains the correlation at high metallicity observed
locally, but also the peculiarity found at low metallicity, which cannot
be accounted for by a simple correlation between metallicity and planet
probability.

	Abstract = {{From a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 102 F and G dwarf stars
we present abundance trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks for 14
elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, Ba, and Eu).
Stellar parameters and elemental abundances (except for Y, Ba and Eu)
for 66 of the 102 stars were presented in our previous studies (Bensby
et al. [CITE], A{\amp}A, 410, 527, [CITE], A{\amp}A, 415, 155). The 36
stars that are new in this study extend and confirm our previous results
and allow us to draw further conclusions regarding abundance trends. The
s-process elements Y and Ba, and the r-element Eu have also been
considered here for the whole sample for the first time. With this new
larger sample we now have the following results: 1) smooth and distinct
abundance trends that for the thin and thick disks are clearly
separated; 2) the {$\alpha$}-element trends for the thick disk show typical
signatures from the enrichment of SN Ia; 3) the thick disk stellar
sample is in the mean older than the thin disk stellar sample; 4) the
thick disk abundance trends are invariant with galactocentric radii
(R\_m); 5) the thick disk abundance trends appear to be invariant with
vertical distance (Z\_max) from the Galactic plane. Adding further
evidence from the literaure we argue that a merger/interacting scenario
with a companion galaxy to produce a kinematical heating of the stars
(that make up today's thick disk) in a pre-existing old thin disk is the
most likely formation scenario for the Galactic thick disk. The 102
stars have -1 {\lsim} [Fe/H] {\lsim} +0.4 and are all in the solar
neighbourhood. Based on their kinematics they have been divided into a
thin disk sample and a thick disk sample consisting of 60 and 38 stars,
respectively. The remaining 4 stars have kinematics that make them
kinematically intermediate to the two disks. Their chemical abundances
also place them in between the two disks. Which of the two disk
populations these 4 stars belong to, or if they form a distinct
population of their own, can at the moment not be settled. The 66 stars
from our previous studies were observed with the FEROS spectrograph on
the ESO 1.5-m telescope and the CES spectrograph on the ESO 3.6-m
telescope. Of the 36 new stars presented here 30 were observed with the
SOFIN spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, 3 with
the UVES spectrograph on VLT/UT2, and 3 with the FEROS spectrograph on
the ESO 1.5-m telescope. All spectra have high signal-to-noise ratios
(typically S/N{\gsim} 250) and high resolution (R{\tilde} 80 000, 45 000,
and 110 000 for the SOFIN, FEROS, and UVES spectra, respectively).

	Abstract = {{Based on spectra from F and G dwarf stars, we present elemental
abundance trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks in the metallicity
regime -0.8$\lt${\tilde} [Fe/H] $\lt${\tilde} +0.4. Our findings can be
summarized as follows. 1) Both the thin and the thick disks show smooth
and distinct abundance trends that, at sub-solar metallicities, are
clearly separated. 2) For the alpha -elements the thick disk shows
signatures of chemical enrichment from SNe type Ia. 3) The age of the
thick disk sample is in the mean older than the thin disk sample. 4)
Kinematically, there exist thick disk stars with super-solar
metallicities. Based on these findings, together with other constraints
from the literature, we discuss different formation scenarios for the
thick disk. We suggest that the currently most likely formation scenario
is a violent merger event or a close encounter with a companion galaxy.
Based on kinematics the stellar sample was selected to contain stars
with high probabilities of belonging either to the thin or to the thick
Galactic disk. The total number of stars are 66 of which 21 belong to
the thick disk and 45 to the thin disk. The analysis is based on
high-resolution spectra with high signal-to-noise (R \~{}  48 000 and S/N
gtrsim  150, respectively) recorded with the FEROS spectrograph on La
Silla, Chile. Abundances have been determined for four alpha -elements
(Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), for four even-nuclei iron peak elements (Cr, Fe,
Ni, and Zn), and for the light elements Na and Al, from equivalent width
measurements of  \~{} 30 000 spectral lines. An extensive investigation of
the atomic parameters, log  gf-values in particular, have been performed
in order to achieve abundances that are trustworthy. Noteworthy is that
we find for Ti good agreement between the abundances from Ti I and Ti
Ii. Our solar Ti abundances are in concordance with the standard
meteoritic Ti abundance

	Abstract = {{We performed a uniform and detailed analysis of 1112 high-resolution
spectra of FGK dwarfs obtained with the HARPS spectrograph at the ESO
3.6 m telescope (La Silla, Chile). Most stars have effective
temperatures 4700 K {\le} T$_{eff}$ {\le} 6300 K and lie in the
metallicity range of -1.39 {\le} [Fe/H] {\le} 0.55. Our main goal is to
investigate whether there are any differences between the elemental
abundance trends (especially [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratio) for stars of different
subpopulations. The equivalent widths of spectral lines are
automatically measured from HARPS spectra with the ARES code. The
abundances of three {$\alpha$} elements are determined using a differential
LTE analysis relative to the Sun, with the 2010 revised version of the
spectral synthesis code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres.
The stars of our sample fall into two populations, clearly separated in
terms of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] up to super-solar metallicities. In turn,
high-{$\alpha$} stars are also separated into two families with a gap in
both [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] {\ap} 0.17) and metallicity ([Fe/H] {\ap}
-0.2) distributions. The metal-poor high-{$\alpha$} stars (thick disk) and
metal-rich high-{$\alpha$} stars are on average older than chemically
defined thin disk stars (low-{$\alpha$} stars). The two {$\alpha$}-enhanced
families have different kinematics and orbital parameters. The
metal-rich {$\alpha$}-enhanced stars, such as thin disk stars have nearly
circular orbits, close to the Galactic plane. We put forward the idea
that these stars may have been formed in the inner Galactic disk, but
their exact nature still remains to be clarified.

	Abstract = {{The heaviest iron-peak element, Zn has been used as an important tracer
of cosmic chemical evolution. Spectroscopic observations of the
metal-poor stars in Local Group galaxies show that an increasing trend
of [Zn/Fe] ratios toward lower metallicity. However, enrichment of Zn in
galaxies is not well understood due to the poor knowledge of
astrophysical sites of Zn as well as metal mixing in galaxies. Here we
show possible explanations for the observed trend by taking into account
electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) as one of the sources of Zn in our
chemodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies. We find that the ejecta
from ECSNe contribute to stars with [Zn/Fe] $\gtrsim$ 0.5. We also find
that scatters of [Zn/Fe] in higher metallicity originate from the ejecta
of type Ia supernovae. On the other hand, it appears difficult to
explain the observed trends if we do not consider ECSNe as a source of
Zn. These results come from inhomogeneous spatial metallicity
distribution due to the inefficiency of metal mixing. We find that the
optimal value of scaling factor for metal diffusion coefficient is
$\sim$ 0.01 in the shear-based metal mixing model in smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations. These results suggest that ECSNe can be one
of the contributors to the enrichment of Zn in galaxies.

	Abstract = {{We derive atmospheric parameters and lithium abundances for 671 stars
and include our measurements in a literature compilation of 1381 dwarf
and subgiant stars. First, a ``lithium desert'' in the effective
temperature (T $_{eff}$) versus lithium abundance (A
$_{Li}$) plane is observed such that no stars with T
$_{eff}$ \~{}= 6075 K and A $_{Li}$ \~{}= 1.8 are found. We
speculate that most of the stars on the low A $_{Li}$ side of the
desert have experienced a short-lived period of severe surface lithium
destruction as main-sequence or subgiant stars. Next, we search for
differences in the lithium content of thin-disk and thick-disk stars,
but we find that internal processes have erased from the stellar
photospheres their possibly different histories of lithium enrichment.
Nevertheless, we note that the maximum lithium abundance of thick-disk
stars is nearly constant from [Fe/H] = -1.0 to -0.1, at a value that is
similar to that measured in very metal-poor halo stars (A $_{Li}$
\~{}= 2.2). Finally, differences in the lithium abundance distribution of
known planet-host stars relative to otherwise ordinary stars appear when
restricting the samples to narrow ranges of T $_{eff}$ or mass,
but they are fully explained by age and metallicity biases. We confirm
the lack of a connection between low lithium abundance and planets.
However, we find that no low A $_{Li}$ planet-hosts are found in
the desert T $_{eff}$ window. Provided that subtle sample biases
are not responsible for this observation, this suggests that the
presence of gas giant planets inhibit the mechanism responsible for the
lithium desert.

	Abstract = {{Lithium abundance in most of the warm metal-poor main sequence stars
shows a constant plateau (A(Li)\~{}2.2 dex) and then the upper envelope of
the lithium vs. metallicity distribution increases as we approach solar
metallicity. Meteorites, which carry information about the chemical
composition of the interstellar medium at the solar system formation
time, show a lithium abundance A(Li)\~{}3.26 dex. This pattern reflects the
Li enrichment history of the interstellar medium during the Galaxy
lifetime. After the initial Li production in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,
the sources of the enrichment include AGB stars, low-mass red giants,
novae, type II supernovae, and Galactic cosmic rays. The total amount of
enriched Li is sensitive to the relative contribution of these sources.
Thus different Li enrichment histories are expected in the Galactic
thick and thin disc. We investigate the main sequence stars observed
with UVES in Gaia-ESO Survey iDR4 catalog and find a Li-[alpha/Fe]
anticorrelation independent of [Fe/H], Teff, and log(g). Since in
stellar evolution different $\{$$\backslash$alpha$\}$ enhancements at the same
metallicity do not lead to a measurable Li abundance change, the
anticorrelation indicates that more Li is produced during the Galactic
thin disc phase than during the Galactic thick disc phase. We also find
a correlation between the abundance of Li and s-process elements Ba and
Y, and they both decrease above the solar metallicity, which can be
explained in the framework of the adopted Galactic chemical evolution
models.

	Abstract = {{Context. Recent observations suggest a double-branch behaviour of Li/H
versus metallicity in the local thick and thin discs. This is
reminiscent of the corresponding O/Fe versus Fe/H behaviour, which has
been explained as resulting from radial migration in the Milky Way disc.
<BR /> Aims: We study here the role of radial migration in shaping these
observations. <BR /> Methods: We use a semi-analytical model of disc
evolution with updated chemical yields and parameterised radial
migration. We explore the cases of long-lived (red giants of a few Gy
lifetime) and shorter-lived (asymptotic giant branch stars of several
10$^{8}$ yr) stellar sources of Li, as well as those of low and
high primordial Li. We show that both factors play a key role in the
overall Li evolution. <BR /> Results: We find that the observed
two-branch Li behaviour is only directly obtained in the case of
long-lived stellar Li sources and low primordial Li. In all other cases,
the data imply systematic Li depletion in stellar envelopes, thus no
simple picture of the Li evolution can be obtained. This concerns also
the reported Li/H decrease at supersolar metallicities.

	Abstract = {{We present sodium abundances for a sample of nearby stars. All results
have been derived from NLTE statistical equilibrium calculations. The
influence of collisional interactions with electrons and hydrogen atoms
is evaluated by comparison of the solar spectrum with very precise fits
to the Na I line cores. The NLTE effects are more pronounced in
metal-poor stars since the statistical equilibrium is dominated by
collisions of which at least the electronic component is substantially
reduced. The resulting influence on the determination of sodium
abundances is in a direction opposite to that found previously for Mg
and Al. The NLTE corrections are about -0.1 in thick-disk stars with
[Fe/H] {\tilde}-0.6. Our [Na/Fe] abundance ratios are about solar for
thick- and thin-disk stars. The increase in [Na/Fe] as a function of
[Fe/H] for metal-rich stars found by Edvardsson et al. ($\backslash$cite$\{$EAG93$\}$) is
confirmed. Our results suggest that sodium yields increase with the
metallicity, and quite large amounts of sodium may be produced by AGB
stars. We find that [Na/Fe] ratios, together with either [Mg/Fe] ratio,
kinematic data or stellar evolutionary ages, make possible the
individual discrimination between thin- and thick-disk membership.

	Abstract = {{Neutral sodium is a minority species in the atmospheres of late-type
stars, and line formation in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is
often a poor assumption, in particular for strong lines. We present an
extensive grid of non-LTE calculations for several Na I lines in cool
stellar atmospheres, including metal-rich and metal-poor dwarfs and
giants. For the first time, we constructed a Na model atom that
incorporates accurate quantum mechanical calculations for collisional
excitation and ionisation by electrons as well as collisional excitation
and charge exchange reactions with neutral hydrogen. Similar to Li I,
the new rates for hydrogen impact excitation do not affect the
statistical equilibrium calculations, while charge exchange reactions
have a small but non-negligible influence. The presented LTE and non-LTE
curves-of-growth can be interpolated to obtain non-LTE abundances and
abundance corrections for arbitrary stellar parameter combinations and
line strengths. The typical corrections for weak lines are -0.1... -0.2
dex, whereas saturated lines may overestimate the abundance in LTE by
more than 0.5 dex. The non-LTE Na abundances appear very robust with
respect to uncertainties in the input collisional data.

@article{Osorio2015,
	Abstract = {{Context. Magnesium is an element of significant astrophysical
importance, often traced in late-type stars using lines of neutral
magnesium, which is expected to be subject to departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The importance of Mg , together with
the unique range of spectral features in late-type stars probing
different parts of the atom, as well as its relative simplicity from an
atomic physics point of view, makes it a prime target and test bed for
detailed ab initio non-LTE modelling in stellar atmospheres. Previous
non-LTE modelling of spectral line formation has, however, been subject
to uncertainties due to lack of accurate data for inelastic collisions
with electrons and hydrogen atoms. <BR /> Aims: In this paper we build
and test a Mg model atom for spectral line formation in late-type stars
with new or recent inelastic collision data and no associated free
parameters. We aim to reduce these uncertainties and thereby improve the
accuracy of Mg non-LTE modelling in late-type stars. <BR /> Methods: For
the low-lying states of Mg i, electron collision data were calculated
using the R-matrix method. Hydrogen collision data, including charge
transfer processes, were taken from recent calculations by some of us.
Calculations for collisional broadening by neutral hydrogen were also
performed where data were missing. These calculations, together with
data from the literature, were used to build a model atom. This model
was then employed in the context of standard non-LTE modelling in 1D
(including average 3D) model atmospheres in a small set of stellar
atmosphere models. First, the modelling was tested by comparisons with
observed spectra of benchmark stars with well-known parameters. Second,
the spectral line behaviour and uncertainties were explored by extensive
experiments in which sets of collisional data were changed or removed.
<BR /> Results: The modelled spectra agree well with observed spectra
from benchmark stars, showing much better agreement with line profile
shapes than with LTE modelling. The line-to-line scatter in the derived
abundances shows some improvements compared to LTE (where the cores of
strong lines must often be ignored), particularly when coupled with
averaged 3D models. The observed Mg emission features at 7 and 12 {$\mu$}m
in the spectra of the Sun and Arcturus, which are sensitive to the
collision data, are reasonably well reproduced. Charge transfer with H
is generally important as a thermalising mechanism in dwarfs, but less
so in giants. Excitation due to collisions with H is found to be quite
important in both giants and dwarfs. The R-matrix calculations for
electron collisions also lead to significant differences compared to
when approximate formulas are employed. The modelling predicts non-LTE
abundance corrections {$\Delta$}A(Mg )$_{<SUB>NLTE-LTE}$</SUB> in
dwarfs, both solar metallicity and metal-poor, to be very small (of
order 0.01 dex), even smaller than found in previous studies. In giants,
corrections vary greatly between lines, but can be as large as 0.4 dex.
<BR /> Conclusions: Our results emphasise the need for accurate data of
Mg collisions with both electrons and H atoms for precise non-LTE
predictions of stellar spectra, but demonstrate that such data can be
calculated and that ab initio non-LTE modelling without resort to free
parameters is possible. In contrast to Li and Na, where only the
introduction of charge transfer processes has led to differences with
respect to earlier non-LTE modelling, the more complex case of Mg finds
changes due to improvements in the data for collisional excitation by
electrons and hydrogen atoms, as well as due to the charge transfer
processes. Grids of departure coefficients and abundance corrections for
a range of stellar parameters are planned for a forthcoming paper.

	Abstract = {{The stellar disc of the Milky Way shows complex spatial and abundance
structure that is central to understanding the key physical mechanisms
responsible for shaping our Galaxy. In this study, we use six very high
resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-sized haloes to
study the prevalence and formation of chemically distinct disc
components. We find that our simulations develop a clearly bimodal
distribution in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. We find two main pathways
to creating this dichotomy, which operate in different regions of the
galaxies: (a) an early (z $\gt$ 1) and intense high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] star
formation phase in the inner region (R {\lsim} 5 kpc) induced by gas-rich
mergers, followed by more quiescent low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] star formation; and
(b) an early phase of high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] star formation in the outer disc
followed by a shrinking of the gas disc owing to a temporarily lowered
gas accretion rate, after which disc growth resumes. In process (b), a
double-peaked star formation history around the time and radius of disc
shrinking accentuates the dichotomy. If the early star formation phase
is prolonged (rather than short and intense), chemical evolution
proceeds as per process (a) in the inner region, but the dichotomy is
less clear. In the outer region, the dichotomy is only evident if the
first intense phase of star formation covers a large enough radial range
before disc shrinking occurs; otherwise, the outer disc consists of only
low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] sequence stars. We discuss the implication that both
processes occurred in the Milky Way.

present non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) modeling of aluminium

transition rates for collisions with hydrogen atoms, without the need

perform 3D NLTE modeling of aluminium lines in the solar spectrum. We
also compute and make available extensive grids of abundance corrections
for lines in the optical and near-infrared using one-dimensional model
atmospheres, and apply grids of precomputed departure coefficients to
direct line synthesis for a set of benchmark stars with accurately known
stellar parameters. <BR /> Results: Our 3D NLTE modeling of the solar
spectrum reproduces observed center-to-limb variations in the solar
spectrum of the 7835 {\AA} line as well as the mid-infrared
photospheric emission line at 12.33 {$\mu$}m. We infer a 3D NLTE solar
photospheric abundance of A(Al) = 6.43 {\plusmn} 0.03, in exact agreement

corrections are positive and may be as large as +1 dex, while
corrections for subordinate lines generally have positive sign for warm
stars but negative for cool stars. Our modeling reproduces the observed
line profiles of benchmark K-giants, and we find abundance corrections

	Abstract = {{As one of the most important elements in astronomy, iron abundance
determinations need to be as accurate as possible. We investigate the
accuracy of spectroscopic iron abundance analyses using archetypal
metal-poor stars. We perform detailed 3D non-LTE radiative transfer
calculations based on 3D hydrodynamic STAGGER model atmospheres, and
employ a new model atom that includes new quantum-mechanical neutral
hydrogen collisional rate coefficients. With the exception of the red
giant HD122563, we find that the 3D non-LTE models achieve Fe I/Fe II
excitation and ionization balance as well as not having any trends with
equivalent width to within modelling uncertainties of 0.05 dex, all
without having to invoke any microturbulent broadening; for HD122563 we
predict that the current best parallax-based surface gravity is
overestimated by 0.5 dex. Using a 3D non-LTE analysis, we infer iron
abundances from the 3D model atmospheres that are roughly 0.1 dex higher
than corresponding abundances from 1D MARCS model atmospheres; these
differences go in the same direction as the non-LTE effects themselves.
We make available grids of departure coefficients, equivalent widths and
abundance corrections, calculated on 1D MARCS model atmospheres and
horizontally and temporally averaged 3D STAGGER model atmospheres.

	Abstract = {{We present and discuss new determinations of metallicity, rotation, age,
kinematics, and Galactic orbits for a complete, magnitude-limited, and
kinematically unbiased sample of 16 682 nearby F and G dwarf stars. Our
{\tilde}63 000 new, accurate radial-velocity observations for nearly 13
500 stars allow identification of most of the binary stars in the sample
and, together with published uvby{$\beta$} photometry, Hipparcos
parallaxes, Tycho-2 proper motions, and a few earlier radial velocities,
complete the kinematic information for 14 139 stars. These high-quality
velocity data are supplemented by effective temperatures and
metallicities newly derived from recent and/or revised calibrations. The
remaining stars either lack Hipparcos data or have fast rotation.  A
major effort has been devoted to the determination of new isochrone ages
for all stars for which this is possible. Particular attention has been
given to a realistic treatment of statistical biases and error
estimates, as standard techniques tend to underestimate these effects
and introduce spurious features in the age distributions. Our ages agree
well with those by Edvardsson et al. ($\backslash$cite$\{$edv93$\}$), despite several
astrophysical and computational improvements since then. We demonstrate,
however, how strong observational and theoretical biases cause the
distribution of the observed ages to be very different from that of the
true age distribution of the sample.  Among the many basic relations of
the Galactic disk that can be reinvestigated from the data presented
here, we revisit the metallicity distribution of the G dwarfs and the
age-metallicity, age-velocity, and metallicity-velocity relations of the
Solar neighbourhood. Our first results confirm the lack of metal-poor G
dwarfs relative to closed-box model predictions (the ``G dwarf
problem''), the existence of radial metallicity gradients in the disk,
the small change in mean metallicity of the thin disk since its
formation and the substantial scatter in metallicity at all ages, and
the continuing kinematic heating of the thin disk with an efficiency
consistent with that expected for a combination of spiral arms and giant
molecular clouds. Distinct features in the distribution of the V
component of the space motion are extended in age and metallicity,
corresponding to the effects of stochastic spiral waves rather than
classical moving groups, and may complicate the identification of
thick-disk stars from kinematic criteria. More advanced analyses of this
rich material will require careful simulations of the selection criteria
for the sample and the distribution of observational errors.

Based on observations made with the Danish 1.5-m telescope at ESO, La
Silla, Chile, and with the Swiss 1-m telescope at Observatoire de
Haute-Provence, France.

	Abstract = {{We show that the masses of red giant stars can be well predicted from
their photospheric carbon and nitrogen abundances, in conjunction with
their spectroscopic stellar labels log g, T$_{eff}$, and [Fe/H].
This is qualitatively expected from mass-dependent post-main-sequence
evolution. We here establish an empirical relation between these
quantities by drawing on 1475 red giants with asteroseismic mass
estimates from Kepler that also have spectroscopic labels from Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) DR12. We assess
the accuracy of our model, and find that it predicts stellar masses with
fractional rms errors of about 14 per cent (typically 0.2
M$_{&sun;}$). From these masses, we derive ages with rms errors of
40 per cent. This empirical model allows us for the first time to make
age determinations (in the range 1-13 Gyr) for vast numbers of giant
stars across the Galaxy. We apply our model to {\tilde}52 000 stars in
APOGEE DR12, for which no direct mass and age information was previously
available. We find that these estimates highlight the vertical age
structure of the Milky Way disc, and that the relation of age with
[{$\alpha$}/M] and metallicity is broadly consistent with established
expectations based on detailed studies of the solar neighbourhood.

@article{Ness2016,
	Abstract = {{The mass of a star is arguably its most fundamental parameter. For red
giant stars, tracers luminous enough to be observed across the Galaxy,
mass implies a stellar evolution age. It has proven to be extremely
difficult to infer ages and masses directly from red giant spectra using
existing methods. From the Kepler and apogee surveys, samples of several
thousand stars exist with high-quality spectra and asteroseismic masses.
Here we show that from these data we can build a data-driven spectral
model using The Cannon, which can determine stellar masses to
{\tilde}0.07 dex from apogee dr12 spectra of red giants; these imply age
estimates accurate to {\tilde}0.2 dex (40\%). We show that The Cannon
constrains these ages foremost from spectral regions with CN absorption
lines, elements whose surface abundances reflect mass-dependent
dredge-up. We deliver an unprecedented catalog of 70,000 giants
(including 20,000 red clump stars) with mass and age estimates, spanning
the entire disk (from the Galactic center to R{\tilde} 20 kpc). We show
that the age information in the spectra is not simply a corollary of the
birth-material abundances $\{$$\{$[Fe/H]$\}$$\}$ and [{$\alpha$} /$\{$Fe$\}$], and that, even
within a monoabundance population of stars, there are age variations
that vary sensibly with Galactic position. Such stellar age constraints
across the Milky Way open up new avenues in Galactic archeology.

stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and overall
metallicity) are computed using the RAVE DR4 stellar pipeline, but
calibrated using recent K2 Campaign 1 seismic gravities and Gaia
benchmark stars, as well as results obtained from high-resolution
studies. Also included are temperatures from the Infrared Flux Method,
and we provide a catalog of red giant stars in the dereddened color
$\{$(J-$\{$Ks$\}$)$\}$$_{0}$ interval (0.50, 0.85) for which the gravities
were calibrated based only on seismology. Further data products for
subsamples of the RAVE stars include individual abundances for Mg, Al,
Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni, and distances found using isochrones. Each RAVE
spectrum is complemented by an error spectrum, which has been used to
determine uncertainties on the parameters. The data can be accessed via

velocities for 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when
including reobservations). Those data were obtained on 67 nights between
2003 April 11 and 2004 April 3. The total sky coverage within this data
release is \~{}4760 deg$^{2}$. The average signal-to-noise ratio of
the observed spectra is 29.5, and 80\% of the radial velocities have
uncertainties better than 3.4 km s$^{-1}$. Combining internal
errors and zero-point errors, the mode is found to be 2 km
s$^{-1}$. Repeat observations are used to assess the stability of
our radial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km
s$^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the radial velocities derived for
the first data set do not show any systematic trend with color or
signal-to-noise ratio. The RAVE radial velocities are complemented in
the data release with proper motions from Starnet 2.0, Tycho-2, and
SuperCOSMOS, in addition to photometric data from the major optical and
infrared catalogs (Tycho-2, USNO-B, DENIS, and the Two Micron All Sky
Survey). The data release can be accessed via the RAVE Web site.

	Abstract = {{It is now well-established that the elemental abundance patterns of
stars hold key clues not only to their formation, but also to the
assembly histories of galaxies. One of the most exciting possibilities
is the use of stellar abundance patterns as {\ldquo}chemical tags{\rdquo}
to identify stars that were born in the same molecular cloud. In this
paper, we assess the prospects of chemical tagging as a function of
several key underlying parameters. We show that in the fiducial case of
10$^{4}$ distinct cells in chemical space and
$\{$10$\}$$^{5}$-$\{$10$\}$$^{6}$ stars in the survey, one can expect to
detect {\sim} $\{$10$\}$$^{2}$-$\{$10$\}$$^{3}$ groups that are {\ge}slant
5{$\sigma$}  overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that
even very large overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that
the overdensity is due to a single set of stars from a common birth
cloud. In fact, for our fiducial model parameters, the typical 5{$\sigma$} 
overdensity is comprised of stars from a wide range of clusters with the
most dominant cluster contributing only 25\% of the stars. The most
important factors limiting the identification of disrupted clusters via
chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in the chemical space
and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar population. Both
of these factors can be improved through strategic observational plans.
While recovering individual clusters through chemical tagging may prove
challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, that different
CMFs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. These
differences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the
slope and high-mass cutoff of CMF and its evolution through cosmic time.

	Abstract = {{Globular clusters are tracers of the history of star formation and
chemical enrichment in the early Galaxy. Their abundance pattern can
help understanding their chemical enrichment processes. In particular,
the iron-peak elements have been relatively little studied so far in the
Galactic bulge. The abundances of iron-peak elements are derived for the
sample clusters, and compared with bulge field, and thick disk stars. We
derive abundances of the iron-peak elements Sc, V, Mn, Cu, and Zn in
individual stars of five bulge globular clusters (NGC 6528, NGC 6553,
NGC 6522, NGC 6558, HP1), and of the reference thick disk/inner halo
cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104). High resolution spectra were obtained with
the UVES spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope over the years. The
sample globular clusters studied span metallicities in the range
-1.2$\lt$Fe/H]$\lt$0.0. V and Sc appear to vary in lockstep with Fe,
indicating that they are produced in the same supernovae as Fe. We find
that Mn is deficient in metal-poor stars, confirming that it is
underproduced in massive stars; Mn-over-Fe steadily increases at the
higher metallicities due to a metallicity-dependent enrichment by
supernovae of type Ia. Cu behaves as a secondary element, indicating its
production in a weak-s process in massive stars. Zn has an alpha-like
behaviour at low metallicities, which can be explained in terms of
nucleosynthesis in hypernovae. At the metal-rich end, Zn decreases with
increasing metallicity, similarly to the alpha-elements.

	Abstract = {{Context. Carbon and oxygen abundances in stars are important in many
fields of astrophysics including nucleosynthesis, stellar structure,
evolution of galaxies, and formation of planetary systems. Still, our
knowledge of the abundances of these elements in different stellar
populations is uncertain because of difficulties in observing and
analyzing atomic and molecular lines of C and O. <BR /> Aims: Abundances
of C, O, and Fe are determined for F and G main-sequence stars in the
solar neighborhood with metallicities in the range -1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$
+0.4 in order to study trends and possible systematic differences in the
C/Fe, O/Fe, and C/O ratios for thin- and thick-disk stars as well as
high- and low-alpha halo stars. In addition, we investigate if there is
any connection between C and O abundances in stellar atmospheres and the
occurrence of planets. <BR /> Methods: Carbon abundances are determined
from the {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$} 5052,5380 C i lines and oxygen abundances from
the {$\lambda$}7774 O i triplet and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300
{\AA}. MARCS model atmospheres are applied and non-LTE corrections for
the O i triplet are included. <BR /> Results: Systematic differences
between high- and low-alpha halo stars and between thin- and thick-disk
stars are seen in the trends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe]. The two halo
populations and thick-disk stars show the same trend of [C/O] versus
[O/H], whereas the thin-disk stars are shifted to higher [C/O] values.
Furthermore, we find some evidence of higher C/O and C/Fe ratios in
stars hosting planets than in stars for which no planets have been
detected. <BR /> Conclusions: The results suggest that C and O in both
high- and low-alpha halo stars and in thick-disk stars are made mainly
in massive (M$\gt$ 8 M$_{&sun;}$) stars, whereas thin-disk stars
have an additional carbon contribution from low-mass AGB and massive
stars of high metallicity causing a rising trend of the C/O ratio with
increasing metallicity. However, at the highest metallicities
investigated ([Fe/H] {\sime} + 0.4), C/O does not exceed 0.8, which seems
to exclude formation of carbon planets if proto-planetary disks have the
same composition as their parent stars.

	Abstract = {{We present a sample of 705 local giant stars observed using the New
Mexico State University 1 m telescope with the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey-III/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
(APOGEE) spectrograph, for which we estimate stellar ages and the local
star formation history (SFH). The high-resolution (R {\tilde} 22,500), near
infrared (1.51-1.7 {$\mu$}m) APOGEE spectra provide measurements of
stellar atmospheric parameters (temperature, surface gravity, [M/H], and
[{$\alpha$}/M]). Due to the smaller uncertainties in surface gravity
possible with high-resolution spectra and accurate Hipparcos distance
measurements, we are able to calculate the stellar masses to within 30\%.
For giants, the relatively rapid evolution up the red giant branch
allows the age to be constrained by the mass. We examine methods of
estimating age using both the mass-age relation directly and a
Bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming a constant
SFH. To improve the SFH prior, we use a hierarchical modeling approach
to constrain the parameters of the model SFH using the age probability
distribution functions of the data. The results of an {$\alpha$}-dependent
Gaussian SFH model show a clear age-[{$\alpha$}/M] relation at all
ages. Using this SFH model as the prior for an empirical Bayesian
analysis, we determine ages for individual stars. The resulting
age-metallicity relation is flat, with a slight decrease in [M/H]
at the oldest ages and a {\tilde}0.5 dex spread in metallicity across most
ages. For stars with ages {\lsim}1 Gyr we find a smaller spread,
consistent with radial migration having a smaller effect on these young
stars than on the older stars.

estimate that for the production of first-peak heavy elements this site
can be of similar importance for galactic chemical evolution as the
s-process production by low-mass AGB stars. The He-shell flashes result
in the expansion and, ultimately, ejection of the accreted and then
I-process enriched material, via super-Eddington-luminosity winds or
Roche-lobe overflow. The WD models do not retain any significant amount
of the accreted mass, with a He retention efficiency of {\lsim} 10 \%
depending on mass and convective boundary mixing assumptions. This makes
the evolutionary path of such systems to supernova Ia explosion highly
unlikely.

	Abstract = {{Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Galactic Halo display
enrichments in heavy elements associated with either the s (slow) or the
r (rapid) neutron-capture process (e.g., barium and europium,
respectively), and in some cases they display evidence of both. The
abundance patterns of these CEMP-s/r stars, which show both Ba and Eu
enrichment, are particularly puzzling, since the s and the r processes
require neutron densities that are more than ten orders of magnitude
apart and, hence, are thought to occur in very different stellar sites
with very different physical conditions. We investigate whether the
abundance patterns of CEMP-s/r stars can arise from the nucleosynthesis
of the intermediate neutron-capture process (the I process), which is
characterized by neutron densities between those of the s and the r
processes. Using nuclear network calculations, we study neutron capture
nucleosynthesis at different constant neutron densities n ranging from
10$^{7}$-10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. With respect to the
classical s process resulting from neutron densities on the lowest side
of this range, neutron densities on the highest side result in abundance
patterns, which show an increased production of heavy s-process and
r-process elements, but similar abundances of the light s-process
elements. Such high values of n may occur in the thermal pulses of
asymptotic giant branch stars due to proton ingestion episodes.
Comparison to the surface abundances of 20 CEMP-s/r stars shows that our
modeled I-process abundances successfully reproduce observed abundance
patterns, which could not be previously explained by s-process
nucleosynthesis. Because the I-process models fit the abundances of
CEMP-s/r stars so well, we propose that this class should be renamed as
CEMP-I.

	Abstract = {{The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ) will search for
planets transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by
NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The
spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around
the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field
optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf
stars with I$_{C}$ (approximately less than) 13 for temporary
drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be
observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending
mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals
will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal
locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space
Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be
recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30
min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the
pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to
characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more
than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are
comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every
four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new
planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest
stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable
targets for detailed investigations.

	Abstract = {{In the era of large stellar spectroscopic surveys, there is an emphasis
on deriving not only stellar abundances but also the ages for millions
of stars. In the context of Galactic archeology, stellar ages provide a
direct probe of the formation history of the Galaxy. We use the stellar
evolution code MESA to compute models with atomic diffusion{\mdash}with
and without radiative acceleration{\mdash}and extra mixing in the surface
layers. The extra mixing consists of both density-dependent turbulent
mixing and envelope overshoot mixing. Based on these models we argue
that it is important to distinguish between initial, bulk abundances
(parameters) and current, surface abundances (variables) in the analysis
of individual stellar ages. In stars that maintain radiative regions on
evolutionary timescales, atomic diffusion modifies the surface
abundances. We show that when initial, bulk metallicity is equated with
current, surface metallicity in isochrone age analysis, the resulting
stellar ages can be systematically overestimated by up to 20\%. The
change of surface abundances with evolutionary phase also complicates
chemical tagging, which is the concept that dispersed star clusters can
be identified through unique, high-dimensional chemical signatures.
Stars from the same cluster, but in different evolutionary phases, will
show different surface abundances. We speculate that calibration of
stellar models may allow us to estimate not only stellar ages but also
initial abundances for individual stars. In the meantime, analyzing the
chemical properties of stars in similar evolutionary phases is essential
to minimize the effects of atomic diffusion in the context of chemical
tagging.

	Abstract = {{Recent works have shown how the [C/N] ratio in stars after the first
dredge-up (FDU) can be used as an age estimator in virtue of its
dependence on stellar mass. For this purpose, precise predictions of the
surface chemical composition before and after the mixing takes place in
the convective envelope of subgiant stars are necessary. Stellar
evolution models can provide us with such predictions, although a
comparison with objects of known age is needed for calibration. Open
clusters are excellent test cases, as they represent a single stellar
population for which the age can be derived through, e.g. isochrone
fitting. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of stars
belonging to the well-known open cluster M67 observed by the Apache
Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey in the
twelfth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and whose chemical
properties were derived with the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical
Abundances Pipeline. We find that the [C/N] abundance of subgiant branch
stars is overestimated by {\tilde}0.2 dex due to an offset in the
determination of the [N/Fe] abundance. Stars on the red giant branch and
red clump are shown not to be affected by this offset. We derive
[C/N]$_{FDU}$ = -0.46 {\plusmn} 0.03 dex, which poses a strong
constraint on calibrations of [C/N]$_{FDU}$ as age indicator. We
also do not find any clear signature of additional chemical mixing
processes that set in after the red giant branch bump. The results
obtained for M67 indicate the importance of conducting high-resolution
spectroscopic studies of open clusters of different ages in order to
establish an accurate age-dating method for field stars.

	Abstract = {{We analyze 494 main sequence turnoff and subgiant stars from the
AMBRE:HARPS survey. These stars have accurate astrometric information
from Gaia DR1, providing reliable age estimates with relative
uncertainties of {\plusmn}1 or 2 Gyr and allowing precise orbital
determinations. The sample is split based on chemistry into a
low-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which are often identified as thin disk stellar
populations, and high-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which are often associated with
thick disk stellar populations. We find that the high-[Mg/Fe] chemical
sequence has extended star formation for several Gyr and is coeval with
the oldest stars of the low-[Mg/Fe] chemical sequence: both the low- and
high-[Mg/Fe] sequences were forming stars at the same time. We find that
the high-[Mg/Fe] stellar populations are only vertically extended for
the oldest, most-metal poor and highest [Mg/Fe] stars. When comparing
vertical velocity dispersion for the low- and high-[Mg/Fe] sequences,
the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence has lower vertical velocity dispersion than
the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence for stars of similar age. This means that
identifying either group as thin or thick disk based on chemistry is
misleading. The stars belonging to the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence have
perigalacticons that originate in the inner disk, while the
perigalacticons of stars on the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence are generally
around the solar neighborhood. From the orbital properties of the stars,
the high-[Mg/Fe] and low-[Mg/Fe] sequences are most likely a reflection
of the chemical enrichment history of the inner and outer disk
populations, respectively; radial mixing causes both populations to be
observed in situ at the solar position. Based on these results, we
emphasize that it is important to be clear in defining what populations
are being referenced when using the terms thin and thick disk, and that
ideally the term thick disk should be reserved for purely geometric
definitions to avoid confusion and be consistent with definitions in
external galaxies.

parameters of the solar twin 18 Sco in a strictly differential sense
relative to the Sun. Our study is mainly based on high-resolution (R \~{}
110,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (800-1,000) Very Large Telescope
UVES spectra, which allow us to achieve a precision of about 0.005 dex
in differential abundances. The effective temperature and surface
gravity of 18 Sco are T $_{eff}$ = 5823 {\plusmn} 6 K and log g =
4.45 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex, i.e., 18 Sco is 46 {\plusmn} 6 K hotter than the
Sun and log g is 0.01 {\plusmn} 0.02 dex higher. Its metallicity is
[Fe/H] = 0.054 {\plusmn} 0.005 dex, and its microturbulence velocity is
+0.02 {\plusmn} 0.01 km s$^{-1}$ higher than solar. Our
precise stellar parameters and differential isochrone analysis show that
18 Sco has a mass of 1.04 {\plusmn} 0.02 M $_{&sun;}$ and that it
is \~{}1.6 Gyr younger than the Sun. We use precise High Accuracy Radial
velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) radial velocities to search for
planets, but none are detected. The chemical abundance pattern of 18 Sco
displays a clear trend with condensation temperature, thus showing
higher abundances of refractories in 18 Sco than in the Sun.
Intriguingly, there are enhancements in the neutron-capture elements
relative to the Sun. Despite the small element-to-element abundance
differences among nearby n-capture elements (\~{}0.02 dex), we successfully
reproduce the r-process pattern in the Solar System. This is independent
evidence for the universality of the r process. Our results have
important implications for chemical tagging in our Galaxy and
nucleosynthesis in general.

	Abstract = {{The chemical composition of the Sun is an essential piece of reference
data for astronomy, cosmology, astroparticle, space and geo-physics:
elemental abundances of essentially all astronomical objects are
referenced to the solar composition, and basically every process
involving the Sun depends on its composition. This article, dealing with
the intermediate-mass elements Na to Ca, is the first in a series
describing the comprehensive re-determination of the solar composition.
In this series we severely scrutinise all ingredients of the analysis
across all elements, to obtain the most accurate, homogeneous and
reliable results possible. We employ a highly realistic 3D hydrodynamic
model of the solar photosphere, which has successfully passed an arsenal
of observational diagnostics. For comparison, and to quantify remaining
systematic errors, we repeat the analysis using three different 1D
hydrostatic model atmospheres (marcs, miss and Holweger {\amp}
M{\"u}ller 1974, Sol. Phys., 39, 19) and a horizontally and
temporally-averaged version of the 3D model ({\mlab} 3D {\mrab}). We
account for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
wherever possible. We have scoured the literature for the best possible
input data, carefully assessing transition probabilities, hyperfine
splitting, partition functions and other data for inclusion in the
analysis. We have put the lines we use through a very stringent quality
check in terms of their observed profiles and atomic data, and discarded
all that we suspect to be blended. Our final recommended 3D+NLTE
abundances are: log {$\epsilon$}$_{Na}$ = 6.21 {\plusmn} 0.04, log
{$\epsilon$}$_{Mg}$ = 7.59 {\plusmn} 0.04, log {$\epsilon$}$_{Al}$
= 6.43 {\plusmn} 0.04, log {$\epsilon$}$_{Si}$ = 7.51 {\plusmn} 0.03,
log {$\epsilon$}$_{P}$ = 5.41 {\plusmn} 0.03, log
{$\epsilon$}$_{S}$ = 7.13 {\plusmn} 0.03, log {$\epsilon$}$_{K}$ =
5.04 {\plusmn} 0.05 and log {$\epsilon$}$_{Ca}$ = 6.32 {\plusmn} 0.03.
The uncertainties include both statistical and systematic errors. Our
results are systematically smaller than most previous ones with the 1D
semi-empirical Holweger {\amp} M{\"u}ller model, whereas the {\mlab} 3D
{\mrab} model returns abundances very similar to the full 3D
calculations. This analysis provides a complete description and a slight
update of the results presented in Asplund et al. (2009, ARA{\amp}A, 47,
481) for Na to Ca, and includes full details of all lines and input data
used.

	Abstract = {{The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our
understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun
and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard
against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are
compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the
solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements,
using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and
accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous
compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy
findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared
to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical
composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency
between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values
obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of
the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has
yet to find a satisfactory resolution.

	Abstract = {{We have shown that data-driven models are effective for inferring
physical attributes of stars (labels; Teff, logg, [M/H]) from spectra,
even when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Here we explore whether this
is possible when the dimensionality of the label space is large (Teff,
logg, and 15 abundances: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn,
Fe, Ni) and the model is non-linear in its response to abundance and
parameter changes. We adopt ideas from compressed sensing to limit
overall model complexity while retaining model freedom. The model is
trained with a set of 12,681 red-giant stars with high signal-to-noise
spectroscopic observations and stellar parameters and abundances taken
from the APOGEE Survey. We find that we can successfully train and use a
model with 17 stellar labels. Validation shows that the model does a
good job of inferring all 17 labels (typical abundance precision is 0.04
dex), even when we degrade the signal-to-noise by discarding \~{}50\% of the
observing time. The model dependencies make sense: the spectral
derivatives with respect to abundances correlate with known atomic
lines, and we identify elements belonging to atomic lines that were
previously unknown. We recover (anti-)correlations in abundance labels
for globular cluster stars, consistent with the literature. However we
find the intrinsic spread in globular cluster abundances is 3--4 times
smaller than previously reported. We deliver 17 labels with associated
errors for 87,563 red giant stars, as well as open-source code to extend
this work to other spectroscopic surveys.

	Year = 2016}

@article{Ho2017,
	Abstract = {{In this era of large-scale spectroscopic stellar surveys, measurements
of stellar attributes ({\ldquo}labels,{\rdquo} i.e., parameters and
abundances) must be made precise and consistent across surveys. Here, we
demonstrate that this can be achieved by a data-driven approach to
spectral modeling. With The Cannon, we transfer information from the
APOGEE survey to determine precise $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$
$\{$$\backslash$text$\{$$\}$$\}$g, [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], and [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$] from the spectra of
450,000 LAMOST giants. The Cannon fits a predictive model for LAMOST
spectra using 9952 stars observed in common between the two surveys,
taking five labels from APOGEE DR12 as ground truth $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$,
$\{$log$\}$ $\{$$\backslash$text$\{$$\}$$\}$g, [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], and K-band extinction
$\{$A$\}$$_{{{k}$$\}$$\}$. The model is then used to infer
$\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$ $\{$$\backslash$text$\{$$\}$$\}$g, [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], and [{$\alpha$}
/$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$] for 454,180 giants, 20\% of the LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. These
are the first [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$] values for the full set of LAMOST giants,
and the largest catalog of [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$] for giant stars to date.
Furthermore, these labels are by construction on the APOGEE label scale;
for spectra with S/N $\gt$ 50, cross-validation of the model yields
typical uncertainties of 70 K in $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, 0.1 in $\{$log$\}$
$\{$$\backslash$text$\{$$\}$$\}$g, 0.1 in [$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$], and 0.04 in [{$\alpha$} /$\{$$\{$M$\}$$\}$], values
comparable to the broadly stated, conservative APOGEE DR12
uncertainties. Thus, by using {\ldquo}label transfer{\rdquo} to tie
low-resolution (LAMOST R {\ap} 1800) spectra to the label scale of a much
higher-resolution (APOGEE R {\ap} 22,500) survey, we substantially reduce
the inconsistencies between labels measured by the individual survey
pipelines. This demonstrates that label transfer with The Cannon can
successfully bring different surveys onto the same physical scale.

	Abstract = {{The formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the great outstanding
problems of astrophysics. Within the broad context of hierachical
structure formation, we have only a crude picture of how galaxies like
our own came into existence. A detailed physical picture where
individual stellar populations can be associated with (tagged to)
elements of the protocloud is far beyond our current understanding.
Important clues have begun to emerge from both the Galaxy (near-field
cosmology) and the high redshift universe (far-field cosmology). Here we
focus on the fossil evidence provided by the Galaxy. Detailed studies of
the Galaxy lie at the core of understanding the complex processes
involved in baryon dissipation. This is a necessary first step toward
achieving a successful theory of galaxy formation.

Averaged spectral fluxes of stars were compared to their photometry to

position and atmospheric conditions. We find that overall the
throughputs of the 771 usable fibres have been stable over the first two
years of its operation. About 2.5 per cent of fibres have throughputs
much lower than the average. There are also a number of yet unexplained
variations between the HERMES bandpasses, and mechanically and optically

of the focal plane. These findings do not impact the science that HERMES
will produce.

	Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive study of the evolution of the abundances of
intermediate mass elements, from C to Zn, in the Milky Way halo and in
the local disk. We use a consistent model to describe the evolution of
those two galactic subsystems. The halo and the disk are assumed to
evolve independently, both starting with gas of primordial composition,
and in different ways: strong outflow is assumed to take place during
the \~{} 1 Gyr of the halo formation, while the disk is built by slowly
infalling gas. This description of the halo+disk evolution can correctly
account for the main observational constraints (at least in the
framework of simple models of galactic chemical evolution). We utilise
then metallicity dependent yields to study the evolution of all elements
from C and Zn. Comparing our results to an extensive body of
observational data (including very recent ones), we are able to make a
critical analysis of the successes and shortcomings of current yields of
massive stars. Finally, we discuss qualitatively some possible ways to
interpret the recent data on oxygen vs iron, which suggest that oxygen
behaves differently from the other alpha-elements.

@article{Lind2009b,
	Abstract = {{Context: To alleviate the discrepancy between the prediction of the
primordial lithium abundance in the universe and the abundances observed
in Pop II dwarfs and subgiant stars, it has been suggested that the
stars observable today have undergone photospheric depletion of lithium.
<BR />Aims: To identify the cause of this depletion, it is important to
accurately establish the behaviour of lithium abundance with effective
temperature and evolutionary phase. Stars in globular clusters are ideal
objects for such an abundance analysis, because relative stellar
parameters can be determined precisely.  <BR />Methods: We conducted a
homogeneous analysis of a very large sample of stars in the metal-poor
globular cluster NGC 6397, covering all evolutionary phases from below
the main sequence turn-off to high up on the red giant branch. Non-LTE
Li abundances or abundance upper limits were obtained for all stars, and
for a sizeable subset of the targets sodium abundances were also
obtained. The Na abundances were used to distinguish stars formed out of
pristine material from stars formed out of material affected by
pollution from a previous generation of more massive stars.  <BR
/>Results: The dwarf, turn-off, and early subgiant stars in our sample
form a thin abundance plateau, disrupted in the middle of the subgiant
branch by the Li dilution caused by the first dredge-up. A second steep
abundance drop is seen at the luminosity of the red giant branch bump.
The turn-off stars are more Li-poor, by up to 0.1 dex, than subgiants
that have not yet undergone dredge-up. In addition, hotter dwarfs are
slightly more Li-poor than cooler dwarfs, which may be a signature of
the so-called Li dip in the cluster, commonly seen among Pop I stars.
The feature is however weak. A considerably wide spread in Na abundance
confirms that NGC 6397 has suffered from intracluster pollution in its
infancy and a limited number of Na-enhanced and Li-deficient stars
strongly contribute to forming a significant anti-correlation between
the abundances of Na and Li. It is nevertheless seen that Li abundances
are unaffected by relatively high degrees of pollution. Lithium
abundance trends with effective temperature and stellar luminosity are
compared to predictions from stellar structure models including atomic
diffusion and ad-hoc turbulence below the convection zone. We confirm
previous findings that some turbulence, with strict limits to its
efficiency, is necessary for explaining the observations.

	Abstract = {{The primary sample of the Gaia Data Release 1 is the Tycho-Gaia
Astrometric Solution (TGAS): {\ap}2 million Tycho-2 sources with improved
parallaxes and proper motions relative to the initial catalog. This
increased astrometric precision presents an opportunity to find new
binary stars and moving groups. We search for high-confidence comoving
pairs of stars in TGAS by identifying pairs of stars consistent with
having the same 3D velocity using a marginalized likelihood ratio test
to discriminate candidate comoving pairs from the field population.
Although we perform some visualizations using (bias-corrected) inverse
parallax as a point estimate of distance, the likelihood ratio is
computed with a probabilistic model that includes the covariances of
parallax and proper motions and marginalizes the (unknown) true
distances and 3D velocities of the stars. We find 13,085 comoving star
pairs among 10,606 unique stars with separations as large as 10 pc (our
search limit). Some of these pairs form larger groups through mutual
comoving neighbors: many of these pair networks correspond to known open
clusters and OB associations, but we also report the discovery of
several new comoving groups. Most surprisingly, we find a large number
of very wide ($\gt$ 1 pc) separation comoving star pairs, the number of
which increases with increasing separation and cannot be explained
purely by false-positive contamination. Our key result is a catalog of
high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS. We discuss the utility
of this catalog for making dynamical inferences about the Galaxy,
testing stellar atmosphere models, and validating chemical abundance
measurements.

219025 forms a remarkable ensemble of single K giants with the unique
properties of rapid rotation, very strong Li lines, an asymmetrical
H{$\alpha$} profile, and a large far-infrared excess. Their vsini values
are between 18 and 23 km s$^{-1}$, and their LTE Li abundances,

reveals it to be a \~{}1 M$_{solar}$ giant with a value of
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C approximately equal to 12. A clear
relation between high rotational velocities and very high Li abundances
for K giant stars is found only when asymmetrical H{$\alpha$} profiles and
large far-infrared excesses are present. If we consider single K giants,
we find that among rapid (vsini$\gt$=8 km s$^{-1}$) rotators, a
very large proportion (\~{}50\%) are Li-rich giants. This proportion is in
contrast with a very low proportion (\~{}2\%) of Li-rich stars among the
much more common slowly rotating K giants. This striking difference is

	Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon organic material, as found in the interstellar medium,
exists in complex mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic forms. It is
considered to originate from carbon-enriched giant stars during their
final stages of evolution, when very strong mass loss occurs in a few
thousand years on their way to becoming planetary nebulae. We show here
that the same organic compounds appear to be formed in previous stages
of the evolution of giant stars, more specifically, during the
first-ascending giant branch K-type stars. According to our model, this
happens only when these stars are being abruptly enriched with lithium,
together with the formation of a circumstellar shell with a strong mass
loss during just a few thousand years. This sudden mass loss is, on
average, a thousand times larger than that of normal Li-poor K giant
stars. This shell would later be detached, especially when the star
stops its Li enrichment and a rapid photospheric Li depletion occurs. In
order to gain extra carbon-based material to form the organic
hydrocarbons, as well as to explain the presence of complex inorganic
compounds in these stars, we propose an interaction of these strong
winds with the remaining asteroidal/cometary disks that already existed
around these stars since they were dwarf A-type stars. The mechanism of
interaction presented here is successful in explaining the presence of
inorganic compounds however, it is unable to produce new carbon-free
atoms to form the organic hydrocarbon compounds. Finally, we discuss
some suggestions and speculations that can eventually help solve the
long-standing puzzle of Li-rich giants.

	Abstract = {{We perform non-LTE calculations of lithium in late-type stars for a wide
range of stellar parameters, including quantum mechanical cross-sections
for collisions with neutral hydrogen and the negative hydrogen ion.
Non-LTE abundance corrections for the lithium resonance line at 670.7 nm
and the subordinate line at 610.3 nm, are calculated using 1D MARCS
model atmospheres spanning a grid T\_eff = [4000, 8000] K, log g = [1.0,
5.0], and [Fe/H] = [0.0, -3.0], for lithium abundances in the range
A(Li) = [-0.3, 4.2]. The competing effects of ultraviolet
over-ionization and photon losses in the resonance line govern the
behaviour of the non-LTE effects with stellar parameters and lithium
abundance. The size and sign of the non-LTE abundance corrections vary
significantly over the grid for the 670.7 nm line, but are typically
positive and below 0.15 dex for the 610.3 nm, line. The new collisional
data play a significant role in determining the abundance corrections.

	Abstract = {{We report the discovery of eight lithium-rich field giants found in a
high-resolution spectroscopic sample of over 700 metal-poor stars
([Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.5) selected from the Radial Velocity Experiment survey.
The majority of the Li-rich giants in our sample are very metal-poor
([Fe/H] $\lt$\~{} -1.9), and have a Li abundance (in the form of
$^{7}$Li), A(Li) = log (n(Li)/n(H)) + 12, between 2.30 and 3.63,
well above the typical upper red giant branch (RGB) limit, A(Li) $\lt$
0.5, while two stars, with A(Li) \~{} 1.7-1.8, show similar lithium
abundances to normal giants at the same gravity. We further included two
metal-poor, Li-rich globular cluster giants in our sample, namely the
previously discovered M3-IV101 and newly discovered (in this work)
M68-A96. This comprises the largest sample of metal-poor Li-rich giants
to date. We performed a detailed abundance analysis of all stars,
finding that the majority of our sample stars have elemental abundances
similar to that of Li-normal halo giants. Although the evolutionary
phase of each Li-rich giant cannot be definitively determined, the
Li-rich phase is likely connected to extra mixing at the RGB bump or
early asymptotic giant branch that triggers cool bottom processing in
which the bottom of the outer convective envelope is connected to the
H-burning shell in the star. The surface of a star becomes Li-enhanced
as $^{7}$Be (which burns to $^{7}$Li) is transported to the
stellar surface via the Cameron-Fowler mechanism. We discuss and
discriminate among several models for the extra mixing that can cause Li
production, given the detailed abundances of the Li-rich giants in our
sample.

	Abstract = {{Very high quality spectra of 24 metal-poor halo dwarfs and subgiants
have been acquired with ESO's VLT/UVES for the purpose of determining Li
isotopic abundances. The derived one-dimensional, non-LTE $^{
7}$Li abundances from the Li I 670.8 nm line reveal a pronounced
dependence on metallicity but with negligible scatter around this trend.
Very good agreement is found between the abundances from the Li I 670.8
nm line and the Li I 610.4 nm line. The estimated primordial $^{
7}$Li abundance is
$^{7}$Li/H=(1.1-1.5){\times}10$^{-10}$, which is a factor of
3-4 lower than predicted from standard big bang nucleosynthesis with the
baryon density inferred from the cosmic microwave background.
Interestingly, $^{6}$Li is detected in 9 of our 24 stars at the
$\gt$=2 {$\sigma$} significance level. Our observations suggest the
existence of a $^{ 6}$Li plateau at the level of
log{$\epsilon$}$_{<SUP>6</SUP>Li}$\~{}0.8 however, taking into account
predictions for $^{6}$Li destruction during the pre-main-sequence
evolution tilts the plateau such that the $^{6}$Li abundances
apparently increase with metallicity. Our most noteworthy result is the
detection of $^{6}$Li in the very metal-poor star LP 815-43. Such
a high $^{6}$Li abundance during these early Galactic epochs is
very difficult to achieve by Galactic cosmic-ray spallation and
{$\alpha$}-fusion reactions. It is concluded that both Li isotopes have a
pre-Galactic origin. Possible $^{6}$Li production channels include
protogalactic shocks and late-decaying or annihilating supersymmetric
particles during the era of big bang nucleosynthesis. The presence of
$^{6}$Li limits the possible degree of stellar $^{ 7}$Li
depletion and thus sharpens the discrepancy with standard big bang
nucleosynthesis.

	Abstract = {{Context. Galactic archaeology, the study of the formation and evolution
of the Milky Way by reconstructing its past from its current
constituents, requires precise and accurate knowledge of stellar
parameters for as many stars as possible. To achieve this, a number of
large spectroscopic surveys have been undertaken and are still ongoing.
<BR /> Aims: So far consortia carrying out the different spectroscopic
surveys have used different tools to determine stellar parameters of
stars from their derived effective temperatures (T$_{eff}$),
surface gravities (log g), and metallicities ([Fe/H]); the parameters
can be combined with photometric, astrometric, interferometric, or
asteroseismic information. Here we aim to homogenise the stellar
characterisation by applying a unified tool to a large set of publicly
available spectrophotometric data. <BR /> Methods: We used spectroscopic
data from a variety of large surveys combined with infrared photometry
from 2MASS and AllWISE and compared these in a Bayesian manner with
PARSEC isochrones to derive probability density functions (PDFs) for
stellar masses, ages, and distances. We treated PDFs of pre-helium-core
burning, helium-core burning, and post helium-core burning solutions as
well as different peaks in multimodal PDFs (i.e. each unimodal sub-PDF)
of the different evolutionary phases separately. <BR /> Results: For
over 2.5 million stars we report mass, age, and distance estimates for
each evolutionary phase and unimodal sub-PDF. We report Gaussian,
skewed, Gaussian, truncated Gaussian, modified truncated exponential
distribution or truncated Student's t-distribution functions to
represent each sub-PDF, allowing us to reconstruct detailed PDFs.
Comparisons with stellar parameter estimates from the literature show
good agreement within uncertainties. <BR /> Conclusions: We present
UniDAM, the unified tool applicable to spectrophotometric data of
different surveys, to obtain a homogenised set of stellar parameters.

	Abstract = {{Context. We have entered an era of large spectroscopic surveys in which
we can measure, through automated pipelines, the atmospheric parameters
and chemical abundances for large numbers of stars. Calibrating these
survey pipelines using a set of ``benchmark stars'' in order to evaluate
the accuracy and precision of the provided parameters and abundances is
of utmost importance. The recent proposed set of Gaia FGK benchmark
stars has up to five metal-poor stars but no recommended stars within
-2.0 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.0 dex. However, this metallicity regime is
critical to calibrate properly. <BR /> Aims: In this paper, we aim to
add candidate Gaia benchmark stars inside of this metal-poor gap. We
began with a sample of 21 metal-poor stars which was reduced to 10 stars
by requiring accurate photometry and parallaxes, and high-resolution
archival spectra. <BR /> Methods: The procedure used to determine the
stellar parameters was similar to the previous works in this series for
consistency. The difference was to homogeneously determine the angular
diameter and effective temperature (T$_{eff}$) of all of our stars
using the Infrared Flux Method utilizing multi-band photometry. The
surface gravity (log g) was determined through fitting stellar
evolutionary tracks. The [Fe/H] was determined using four different
spectroscopic methods fixing the T$_{eff}$ and log g from the
values determined independent of spectroscopy. <BR /> Results: We
discuss, star-by-star, the quality of each parameter including how it
compares to literature, how it compares to a spectroscopic run where all
parameters are free, and whether Fe i ionisation-excitation balance is
achieved. <BR /> Conclusions: From the 10 stars, we recommend a sample
of five new metal-poor benchmark candidate stars which have consistent
T$_{eff}$, log g, and [Fe/H] determined through several means.
These stars, which are within -1.3 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.0, can be used
for calibration and validation purpose of stellar parameter and
abundance pipelines and should be of highest priority for future
interferometric studies.

	Abstract = {{The study of stellar parameters of planet-hosting stars, such as
metallicity and chemical abundances, help us to understand the theory of
planet formation and stellar evolution. Here, we present a catalogue of
accurate stellar atmospheric parameters and iron abundances for a sample
of 257 K and G field evolved stars that are being surveyed for planets
using precise radial-velocity measurements as part of the Coralie
programme to search for planets around giants. The analysis was done
using a set of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise Ultraviolet and
Visible Echelle Spectrograph spectra. The stellar parameters were
derived using Fe I and II ionization and excitation equilibrium methods.
To take into account possible effects related to the choice of the lines
on the derived parameters, we used three different iron line-list sets
in our analysis, and the results differ among themselves by a small
factor for most of stars. For those stars with previous literature
parameter estimates, we found very good agreement with our own values.
In the present catalogue, we are providing new precise spectroscopic
measurements of effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence,
and metallicity for 190 stars for which it has not been found or
published in previous articles.

	Abstract = {{We performed a uniform and detailed abundance analysis of 12 refractory
elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Co, Sc, Mn, and V) for a
sample of 257 G- and K-type evolved stars from the CORALIE planet search
programme. To date, only one of these stars is known to harbour a
planetary companion. We aimed to characterize this large sample of
evolved stars in terms of chemical abundances and kinematics, thus
setting a solid base for further analysis of planetary properties around
giant stars. This sample, being homogeneously analysed, can be used as a
comparison sample for other planet-related studies, as well as for
different type of studies related to stellar and Galaxy astrophysics.
The abundances of the chemical elements were determined using an local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis relative to the Sun,
with the spectral synthesis code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9
atmospheres. To separate the Galactic stellar populations, both a purely
kinematical approach and a chemical method were applied. We confirm the
overabundance of Na in giant stars compared to the field FGK dwarfs.
This enhancement might have a stellar evolutionary character, but
departures from LTE may also produce a similar enhancement. Our chemical
separation of stellar populations also suggests a `gap' in metallicity
between the thick-disc and high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich stars, as previously
observed in dwarfs sample from HARPS. The present sample, as most of the
giant star samples, also suffers from the B - V colour cut-off, which
excludes low-log g stars with high metallicities, and high-log g star
with low [Fe/H]. For future studies of planet occurrence dependence on
stellar metallicity around these evolved stars, we suggest to use a
subsample of stars in a `cut-rectangle' in the log g-[Fe/H] diagram to
overcome the aforementioned issue.

	Abstract = {{Context. The Galactic bulge is an intriguing and significant part of our
Galaxy, but it is hard to observe because it is both distant and covered
by dust in the disk. Therefore, there are not many high-resolution
optical spectra of bulge stars with large wavelength coverage, whose
determined abundances can be compared with nearby, similarly analyzed
stellar samples. <BR /> Aims: We aim to determine the diagnostically
important alpha elements of a sample of bulge giants using
high-resolution optical spectra with large wavelength coverage. The
abundances found are compared to similarly derived abundances from
similar spectra of similar stars in the local thin and thick disks. In
this first paper we focus on the solar neighborhood reference sample.
<BR /> Methods: We used spectral synthesis to derive the stellar
parameters as well as the elemental abundances of both the local and
bulge samples of giants. We took special care to benchmark our method of
determining stellar parameters against independent measurements of
effective temperatures from angular diameter measurements and surface
gravities from asteroseismology. <BR /> Results: In this first paper we
present the method used to determine the stellar parameters and
elemental abundances, evaluate them, and present the results for our
local disk sample of 291 giants. <BR /> Conclusions: When comparing our
determined spectroscopic temperatures to those derived from angular
diameter measurements, we reproduce these with a systematic difference
of +10 K and a standard deviation of 53 K. The spectroscopic gravities
reproduce those determined from asteroseismology with a systematic
offset of +0.10 dex and a standard deviation of 0.12 dex. When it comes
to the abundance trends, our sample of local disk giants closely follows
trends found in other works analyzing solar neighborhood dwarfs, showing
that the much brighter giant stars are as good abundance probes as the
often used dwarfs.

@article{Rybizki2017,
	Abstract = {{Elemental abundances of stars are the result of the complex enrichment
history of their galaxy. Interpretation of observed abundances requires
flexible modeling tools to explore and quantify the information about
Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) stored in such data. Here we present
Chempy, a newly developed code for GCE modeling, representing a
parametrized open one-zone model within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy
model is specified by a set of five to ten parameters that describe the
effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar and star-formation
physics: for example, the star-formation history (SFH), the feedback
efficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF), and the incidence
of supernova of type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy
can sample the posterior probability distribution in the full model
parameter space and test data-model matches for different
nucleosynthetic yield sets. It is essentially a chemical evolution
fitting tool. We straightforwardly extend Chempy to a multi-zone scheme.
As an illustrative application, we show that interesting parameter
constraints result from only the ages and elemental abundances of the
Sun, Arcturus, and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For the
first time, we use such information to infer the IMF parameter via GCE
modeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and
account for different yield sets. We find that 11.6$^{+
2.1}$$_{-1.6}$\% of the IMF explodes as core-collapse supernova
(CC-SN), compatible with Salpeter (1955, ApJ, 121, 161). We also
constrain the incidence of SN Ia per 10$^{3}$M$_{&sun;}$ to
0.5-1.4. At the same time, this Chempy application shows persistent
discrepancies between predicted and observed abundances for some
elements, irrespective of the chosen yield set. These cannot be remedied
by any variations of Chempy's parameters and could be an indication of
missing nucleosynthetic channels. Chempy could be a powerful tool to
confront predictions from stellar nucleosynthesis with far more complex
abundance data sets and to refine the physical processes governing the
chemical evolution of stellar systems.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We present the Stagger-grid, a comprehensive grid of
time-dependent, three-dimensional (3D), hydrodynamic model atmospheres
for late-type stars with realistic treatment of radiative transfer,
covering a wide range in stellar parameters. This grid of 3D models is
intended for various applications besides studies of stellar convection
and atmospheres per se, including stellar parameter determination,
stellar spectroscopy and abundance analysis, asteroseismology,
calibration of stellar evolution models, interferometry, and extrasolar
planet search. In this introductory paper, we describe the methods we
applied for the computation of the grid and discuss the general
properties of the 3D models as well as of their temporal and spatial
averages (here denoted {\mlab}3D{\mrab} models). <BR /> Methods: All our
models were generated with the Stagger-code, using realistic input
physics for the equation of state (EOS) and for continuous and line
opacities. Our \~{} 220 grid models range in effective temperature,
T$_{eff}$, from 4000 to 7000 K in steps of 500 K, in surface
gravity, log g, from 1.5 to 5.0 in steps of 0.5 dex, and metallicity,
[Fe/H], from - 4.0 to + 0.5 in steps of 0.5 and 1.0 dex. <BR /> Results:
We find a tight scaling relation between the vertical velocity and the
surface entropy jump, which itself correlates with the constant entropy
value of the adiabatic convection zone. The range in intensity contrast
is enhanced at lower metallicity. The granule size correlates closely
with the pressure scale height sampled at the depth of maximum velocity.
We compare the {\mlab}3D{\mrab} models with currently widely applied
one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models, as well as with theoretical 1D
hydrostatic models generated with the same EOS and opacity tables as the
3D models, in order to isolate the effects of using self-consistent and
hydrodynamic modeling of convection, rather than the classical mixing
length theory approach. For the first time, we are able to quantify
systematically over a broad range of stellar parameters the
uncertainties of 1D models arising from the simplified treatment of
physics, in particular convective energy transport. In agreement with
previous findings, we find that the differences can be rather
significant, especially for metal-poor stars.

	Abstract = {In this brief communication we provide the rationale for and the outcome of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolution vote at the XXIXth General Assembly in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2015, on recommended nominal conversion constants for selected solar and planetary properties. The problem addressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants between solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused a proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar luminosity, solar effective temperature, and solar mass parameter) in the literature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the time of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of consistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in 2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary, and fundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on optimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU 2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The resolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are by definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should be understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary properties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to join in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work and publications to help minimize further confusion.},

	Abstract = {{We present the first APOKASC catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismic
properties of 1916 red giants observed in the Kepler fields. The
spectroscopic parameters provided from the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment project are complemented with
asteroseismic surface gravities, masses, radii, and mean densities
determined by members of the Kepler Asteroseismology Science Consortium.
We assess both random and systematic sources of error and include a
discussion of sample selection for giants in the Kepler fields. Total
uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of the order of 80 K in
T $_{eff}$, 0.06 dex in [M/H], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12\% and 5\%
in mass and radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of
systematic and random errors. Asteroseismic surface gravities are
substantially more precise and accurate than spectroscopic ones, and we
find good agreement between their mean values and the calibrated
spectroscopic surface gravities. There are, however, systematic
underlying trends with T $_{eff}$ and log g. Our effective
temperature scale is between 0 and 200 K cooler than that expected from
the infrared flux method, depending on the adopted extinction map, which
provides evidence for a lower value on average than that inferred for
the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We find a reasonable correspondence
between the photometric KIC and spectroscopic APOKASC metallicity
scales, with increased dispersion in KIC metallicities as the absolute
metal abundance decreases, and offsets in T $_{eff}$ and log g
consistent with those derived in the literature. We present mean fitting
relations between APOKASC and KIC observables and discuss future
prospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.

	Abstract = {{Context. The ongoing Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey is using
FLAMES at the VLT to obtain high-quality medium-resolution Giraffe
spectra for about 10$^{5}$ stars and high-resolution UVES spectra
for about 5000 stars. With UVES, the Survey has already observed 1447
FGK-type stars. <BR /> Aims: These UVES spectra are analyzed in parallel
by several state-of-the-art methodologies. Our aim is to present how
these analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to
describe how a final recommended parameter scale is defined. We also
discuss the precision (method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases
with respect to the reference values) of the final parameters. These
results are part of the Gaia-ESO second internal release and will be
part of its first public release of advanced data products. <BR />
Methods: The final parameter scale is tied to the scale defined by the
Gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmospheric
parameters. In addition, a set of open and globular clusters is used to
evaluate the physical soundness of the results. Each of the implemented
methodologies is judged against the benchmark stars to define weights in
three different regions of the parameter space. The final recommended
results are the weighted medians of those from the individual methods.
<BR /> Results: The recommended results successfully reproduce the
atmospheric parameters of the benchmark stars and the expected
T$_{eff}$-log g relation of the calibrating clusters. Atmospheric
parameters and abundances have been determined for 1301 FGK-type stars
observed with UVES. The median of the method-to-method dispersion of the
atmospheric parameters is 55 K for T$_{eff}$, 0.13 dex for log g
and 0.07 dex for [Fe/H]. Systematic biases are estimated to be between
50-100 K for T$_{eff}$, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g and 0.05-0.10 dex
for [Fe/H]. Abundances for 24 elements were derived: C, N, O, Na, Mg,
Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, Nd,
and Eu. The typical method-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies
between 0.10 and 0.20 dex. <BR /> Conclusions: The Gaia-ESO sample of
high-resolution spectra of FGK-type stars will be among the largest of
its kind analyzed in a homogeneous way. The extensive list of elemental
abundances derived in these stars will enable significant advances in
the areas of stellar evolution and Milky Way formation and evolution.

third of the data taking and continues to acquire high-quality

and field stars in the Galactic Halo, the thick Disc, the thin Disc and
the Galactic Bulge. A large sample of stars in the Solar Neighbourhood,
selected to include all possible ages and metallicities, is also being
observed with UVES. This will be the first such large internally
homogeneous study of the Milky Way stellar populations. Besides the
intrinsic range of exciting scientific results, the Gaia-ESO
Survey is also a pathfinder for future massive Gaia follow-up. Equally
importantly, we are building an ESO-wide community of stellar
spectroscopists, sharing, optimising, refining and cross-calibrating
complementary approaches, strengths and experience. Internal Science
Verification (SV) has started with several results demonstrating the
huge potential of the survey and the first release of spectra to ESO has

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: We have analyzed high-resolution and high
signal-to-noise-ratio optical spectra of nearby FGK stars with and
without detected giant planets in order to homogeneously measure their
photospheric parameters, mass, age, and the abundances of volatile (C,
N, and O) and refractory (Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Ba)
elements. Our sample contains 309 stars from the solar neighborhood (up
to the distance of 100 pc), out of which 140 are dwarfs, 29 are
subgiants, and 140 are giants. <BR /> Methods: The photospheric
parameters are derived from the equivalent widths of Fe i and Fe ii
lines. Masses and ages come from the interpolation in evolutionary
tracks and isochrones on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The abundance
determination is based on the equivalent widths of selected atomic lines
of the refractory elements and on the spectral synthesis of
C$_{2}$, CN, C i, O i, and Na i features. We apply a set of
statistical methods to analyze the abundances derived for the three
subsamples. <BR /> Results: Our results show that: i) giant stars
systematically exhibit underabundance in [C/Fe] and overabundance in
[N/Fe] and [Na/Fe] in comparison with dwarfs, a result that is normally
attributed to evolution-induced mixing processes in the envelope of
evolved stars; ii) for solar analogs alone, the abundance trends with
the condensation temperature of the elements are correlated with age and
anticorrelated with the surface gravity, which agrees with recent
studies; iii) as in the case of [Fe/H], dwarf stars with giant planets
are systematically enriched in [X/H] for all the analyzed elements,
except for O and Ba (the former due to limitations of statistics),
confirming previous findings in the literature that it is not only iron
that has an important relation with the planetary formation; and iv)
giant planet hosts are also significantly overabundant for the same
metallicity when the elements from Mg to Cu are combined.

	Abstract = {{Context. The rich open cluster M 67 is known to have a chemical
composition close to solar and an age of about 3.5-4.8 Gyr. It offers an
important opportunity to check and develop our understanding of the
physics and the evolution of solar-type stars. <BR /> Aims: We present a
spectroscopic study at high resolution, R {\ap} 50 000, of 14 stars
located on the main sequence, at the turn-off point, and on the early
subgiant branch in the cluster in order to investigate its detailed
chemical composition, for comparison with the Sun and solar twins in the
solar neighbourhood, and to explore selective atomic diffusion of
chemical elements as predicted by stellar-structure theory. <BR />
Methods: We have obtained VLT/FLAMES-UVES spectra and analysed these
strictly differentially in order to explore chemical-abundance
similarities and differences between the M 67 stars and the Sun and
among the M 67 stars themselves. <BR /> Results: Individual abundances
of 19 different chemical elements are obtained for the stars. They are
found to agree very well with solar abundances, with abundance ratios
closer to solar than those of most solar twins in the solar
neighbourhood. An exception is Li, which shows considerable scatter
among the cluster stars. There is a tendency for the cluster-star
abundances to be more depleted than the abundances in the field stars in
correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements, a
tendency also found earlier for the Sun. Moreover, the heavy-element
abundances are found to be reduced in the hotter stars and dwarfs by
typically {\le}0.05 dex, as compared to the abundances of the subgiants.
<BR /> Conclusions: The results support the hypothesis that the gas of
the proto-cluster was depleted by formation and cleansing of dust before
the stars formed. They also add support to the proposal that the Sun was
formed in a dense stellar environment. Moreover, the observed minor
reductions of heavy elements, relative to our standard star M 67-1194
and the subgiants, in the atmospheres of dwarfs and turn-off point stars
seem to suggest that diffusion processes are at work in these stars,
although the evidence is not compelling. Based on theoretical models,
the diffusion-corrected initial metallicity of M 67 is estimated to be
[Fe/H] = +0.06.

	Abstract = {{Studying the Milky Way disk structure using stars in narrow bins of
[Fe/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] has recently been proposed as a powerful method
to understand the Galactic thick and thin disk formation. It has been
assumed so far that these mono-abundance populations (MAPs) are also
coeval, or mono-age, populations. Here we study this relationship for a
Milky Way chemodynamical model and show that equivalence between MAPs
and mono-age populations exists only for the high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] tail,
where the chemical evolution curves of different Galactic radii are far
apart. At lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-values an MAP is composed of stars with a
range in ages, even for small observational uncertainties and a small
MAP bin size. Due to the disk inside-out formation, for these MAPs
younger stars are typically located at larger radii, which results in
negative radial age gradients that can be as large as 2 Gyr
kpc$^{-1}$. Positive radial age gradients can result for
MAPs at the lowest [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and highest [Fe/H] end. Such variations
with age prevent the simple interpretation of observations for which
accurate ages are not available. Studying the variation with radius of
the stellar surface density and scale height in our model, we find good
agreement to recent analyses of the APOGEE red-clump (RC) sample when
1-4 Gyr old stars dominate (as expected for the RC). Our results
suggest that the APOGEE data are consistent with a Milky Way model for
which mono-age populations flare for all ages. We propose observational
tests for the validity of our predictions and argue that using accurate
age measurements, such as from asteroseismology, is crucial for putting
constraints on Galactic formation and evolution.

	Abstract = {{The spatial, kinematic, and elemental-abundance structure of the Milky
Way's stellar disk is complex, and has been difficult to dissect with
local spectroscopic or global photometric data. Here, we develop and
apply a rigorous density modeling approach for Galactic spectroscopic
surveys that enables investigation of the global spatial structure of
stellar sub-populations in narrow bins of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H], using
23,767 G-type dwarfs from SDSS/SEGUE, which effectively sample 5 kpc
$\lt$ R $_{GC}$ $\lt$ 12 kpc and 0.3 kpc $\lt$\~{} |Z| $\lt$\~{} 3 kpc. We
fit models for the number density of each such ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] and [Fe/H])
mono-abundance component, properly accounting for the complex
spectroscopic SEGUE sampling of the underlying stellar population, as
well as for the metallicity and color distributions of the samples. We
find that each mono-abundance sub-population has a simple spatial
structure that can be described by a single exponential in both the
vertical and radial directions, with continuously increasing scale
heights ({\ap}200 pc to 1 kpc) and decreasing scale lengths ($\gt$4.5 kpc
to 2 kpc) for increasingly older sub-populations, as indicated by their
lower metallicities and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] enhancements. That the
abundance-selected sub-components with the largest scale heights have
the shortest scale lengths is in sharp contrast with purely geometric
``thick-thin disk'' decompositions. To the extent that [{$\alpha$}/Fe] is an
adequate proxy for age, our results directly show that older disk
sub-populations are more centrally concentrated, which implies
inside-out formation of galactic disks. The fact that the largest
scale-height sub-components are most centrally concentrated in the Milky
Way is an almost inevitable consequence of explaining the vertical
structure of the disk through internal evolution. Whether the simple
spatial structure of the mono-abundance sub-components and the striking
correlations between age, scale length, and scale height can be
plausibly explained by satellite accretion or other external heating
remains to be seen.

assumptions used for the treatment of galactic inflows and outflows
impact numerical predictions. The goal is to determine how our capacity
to reproduce the chemical evolution trends of a galaxy is affected by
the choice of implementation used to include those physical processes.
In pursuit of this goal, we experiment with three different
prescriptions for galactic inflows and outflows and use OMEGA within a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to recover the set of input parameters
that best reproduces the chemical evolution of nine elements in the
dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. This provides a consistent framework
for comparing the best-fit solutions generated by our different models.
Despite their different degrees of intended physical realism, we found
that all three prescriptions can reproduce in an almost identical way
the stellar abundance trends observed in Sculptor. This result supports
the similar conclusions originally claimed by Romano {\amp} Starkenburg
for Sculptor. While the three models have the same capacity to fit the
data, the best values recovered for the parameters controlling the
number of SNe Ia and the strength of galactic outflows, are
substantially different and in fact mutually exclusive from one model to
another. For the purpose of understanding how a galaxy evolves, we
conclude that only reproducing the evolution of a limited number of
elements is insufficient and can lead to misleading conclusions. More
elements or additional constraints such as the Galaxy{\rsquo}s
star-formation efficiency and the gas fraction are needed in order to
break the degeneracy between the different modeling assumptions. Our
results show that the successes and failures of chemical evolution
models are predominantly driven by the input stellar yields, rather than
by the complexity of the Galaxy model itself. Simple models such as
OMEGA are therefore sufficient to test and validate stellar yields.

	Abstract = {{Context. The chemical composition of stars is intimately linked to the
formation and evolution of the Galaxy. <BR /> Aims: We aim to trace the
chemical evolution of the Galactic disk through the inspection of the
[X/Fe]-age relations of 24 species from C to Eu. <BR /> Methods: Using
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise UVES spectra of nine solar
twins, we obtained precise estimates of stellar ages and chemical
abundances. These determinations have been integrated with additional
accurate age and abundance determinations from recent spectroscopic
studies of solar twins existing in the literature, comprising superb
abundances with 0.01 dex precision. Based on this data set, we outlined
the [X/Fe]-age relations over a time interval of 10 Gyr. <BR /> Results:
We present the [X/Fe] - age relations for 24 elements (C, O, Na, Mg, Al,
Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and
Eu). Each different class of elements showed a distinct evolution with
time that relies on the different characteristics, rates, and timescales
of the nucleosynthesis sites from which they are produced. The
{$\alpha$}-elements are characterized by a [X/Fe] decrease with time.
Strikingly, the opposite behavior is observed for Ca. The iron-peak
elements show an early [X/Fe] increase followed by a decrease towards
the youngest stars. The [X/Fe] for the n-capture elements decrease with
age. We also found that both [Mg/Y] and [Al/Y] are precise stellar
clocks, with [Al/Y] showing the steepest dependence on age. <BR />
Conclusions: Knowledge of the [X/Fe]-age relations is a gold mine from
which we can achieve a great understanding of the processes that
governed the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Through the
reverse engineering of these relations we will be able to put strong
constraints on the nature of the stellar formation history, the SNe
rates, the stellar yields, and the variety of the SNe progenitors.

	Abstract = {{I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python
package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists
of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in
python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions,
objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these
as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of
Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits,
integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports
the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for
a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using
state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials,
and making use of a recent general approximation for any static
potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also
included in the current release; currently, these consist of
two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a
three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I
provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a
simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with
the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions
for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new
analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a
kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail.
Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of
code in the module, 11,000 lines of test code, and about 20,000 lines of

	Abstract = {{Context. High-precision determinations of abundances of elements in the
atmospheres of the Sun and solar twin stars indicate that the Sun has an
unusually low ratio between refractory and volatile elements. This has
led to the suggestion that the relation between abundance ratios,
[X/Fe], and elemental condensation temperature, T$_{C}$, can be
used as a signature of the existence of terrestrial planets around a
star. <BR /> Aims: HARPS spectra with S/N {\gsim} 600 for 21 solar twin
stars in the solar neighborhood and the Sun (observed via reflected
light from asteroids) are used to determine very precise ({$\sigma$} \~{} 0.01
dex) differential abundances of elements in order to see how well [X/Fe]
is correlated with T$_{C}$ and other parameters such as stellar
age. <BR /> Methods: Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr,
Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y are derived from equivalent widths of weak and
medium-strong spectral lines using MARCS model atmospheres with
parameters determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe
lines. Non-LTE effects are considered and taken into account for some of
the elements. In addition, precise ({$\sigma$} {\lsim} 0.8 Gyr) stellar ages
are obtained by interpolating between Yonsei-Yale isochrones in the log
g - T$_{eff}$ diagram. <BR /> Results: It is confirmed that the
ratio between refractory and volatile elements is lower in the Sun than
in most of the solar twins (only one star has the same
[X/Fe]-T$_{C}$ distribution as the Sun), but for many stars, the
relation between [X/Fe] and T$_{C}$ is not well defined. For
several elements there is an astonishingly tight correlation between
[X/Fe] and stellar age with amplitudes up to \~{}0.20 dex over an age
interval of eight Gyr in contrast to the lack of correlation between
[Fe/H] and age. While [Mg/Fe] increases with age, the s-process element
yttrium shows the opposite behavior meaning that [Y/Mg] can be used as a
sensitive chronometer for Galactic evolution. The Na/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios
are not well correlated with stellar age, but define a tight Ni-Na
relation similar to that previously found for more metal-poor stars
albeit with a smaller amplitude. Furthermore, the C/O ratio evolves very
little with time, although [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] change by \~{}0.15 dex. <BR />
Conclusions: The dependence of [X/Fe] on stellar age and the [Ni/Fe]-
[Na/Fe] variations complicate the use of the [X/Fe]-T$_{C}$
relation as a possible signature for the existence of terrestrial
planets around stars. The age trends for the various abundance ratios
provide new constraints on supernovae yields and Galactic chemical
evolution, and the slow evolution of C/O for solar metallicity stars is
of interest for discussions of the composition of exoplanets.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: Previously [Y/Mg] has been proven to be an age indicator
for solar twins. Here, we investigate if this relation also holds for
helium-core-burning stars of solar metallicity. <BR /> Methods: High
resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectroscopic data of
stars in the helium-core-burning phase have been obtained with the FIES
spectrograph on the NOT 2.56 m telescope and the HIRES spectrograph on
the Keck I 10 m telescope. They have been analyzed to determine the
chemical abundances of four open clusters with close to solar
metallicity; NGC 6811, NGC 6819, M 67 and NGC 188. The abundances are
derived from equivalent widths of spectral lines using ATLAS9 model
atmospheres with parameters determined from the excitation and
ionization balance of Fe lines. Results from asteroseismology and binary
studies were used as priors on the atmospheric parameters, where
especially the log g is determined to much higher precision than what is
possible with spectroscopy. <BR /> Results: It is confirmed that the
four open clusters are close to solar metallicity and they follow the
[Y/Mg] vs. age trend previously found for solar twins. <BR />
Conclusions: The [Y/Mg] vs. age clock also works for giant stars in the
helium-core burning phase, which vastly increases the possibilities to
estimate the age of stars not only in the solar neighborhood, but in
large parts of the Galaxy, due to the brighter nature of evolved stars
compared to dwarfs.

	Abstract = {{Several recent studies of solar twins in the solar neighbourhood have
shown a tight correlation between various elemental abundances and age,
in particular [Y/Mg]. If this relation is real and valid for other types
of stars as well as elsewhere in the Galaxy, it would provide a very
powerful tool to derive ages of stars without the need to resort to
determining their masses (evolutionary stage) very precisely. The method
would also likely work if the stellar parameters have relatively large
errors. The studies presented in the recent literature span a narrow
range of [Fe/H]. By studying a larger sample of solar neighbourhood
dwarfs with a much larger range of [Fe/H], we find that the relation
between [Y/Mg] and age depends on the [Fe/H] of the stars. Hence, it
appears that the [Y/Mg]-age relation is unique to solar analogues.

@article{Venn2004,
	Abstract = {{To compare the chemistries of stars in the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) satellite galaxies with stars in the Galaxy, we have compiled a
large sample of Galactic stellar abundances from the literature. When
kinematic information is available, we have assigned the stars to
standard Galactic components through Bayesian classification based on
Gaussian velocity ellipsoids. As found in previous studies, the
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios of most stars in the dSph galaxies are generally
lower than similar metallicity Galactic stars in this extended sample.
Our kinematically selected stars confirm this for the Galactic halo,
thin-disk, and thick-disk components. There is marginal overlap in the
low [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios between dSph stars and Galactic halo stars on
extreme retrograde orbits (V$\lt$-420 km s$^{-1}$), but this is not
supported by other element ratios. Other element ratios compared in this
paper include r- and s-process abundances, where we find a significant
offset in the [Y/Fe] ratios, which results in a large overabundance in
[Ba/Y] in most dSph stars compared with Galactic stars. Thus, the
chemical signatures of most of the dSph stars are distinct from the
stars in each of the kinematic components of the Galaxy. This result
rules out continuous merging of low-mass galaxies similar to these dSph
satellites during the formation of the Galaxy. However, we do not rule
out very early merging of low-mass dwarf galaxies, since up to one-half
of the most metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$\lt$=-1.8) have chemistries that are
in fair agreement with Galactic halo stars. We also do not rule out
merging with higher mass galaxies, although we note that the LMC and the
remnants of the Sgr dwarf galaxy are also chemically distinct from the
majority of the Galactic halo stars. Formation of the Galaxy's thick
disk by heating of an old thin disk during a merger is also not ruled
out; however, the Galaxy's thick disk itself cannot be comprised of the
remnants from a low-mass (dSph) dwarf galaxy, nor of a high-mass dwarf
galaxy like the LMC or Sgr, because of differences in chemistry.

The new and independent environments offered by the dSph galaxies also
allow us to examine fundamental assumptions related to the
nucleosynthesis of the elements. The metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$\lt$=-1.8)
in the dSph galaxies appear to have lower [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] than
[Mg/Fe] ratios, unlike similar metallicity stars in the Galaxy.
Predictions from the {$\alpha$}-process ({$\alpha$}-rich freeze-out) would be
consistent with this result if there have been a lack of hypernovae in
dSph galaxies. The {$\alpha$}-process could also be responsible for the
very low Y abundances in the metal-poor stars in dSph's; since [La/Eu]
(and possibly [Ba/Eu]) are consistent with pure r-process results, the
low [Y/Eu] suggests a separate r-process site for this light
(first-peak) r-process element. We also discuss SNe II rates and yields
as other alternatives, however. In stars with higher metallicities
([Fe/H]$\gt$=-1.8), contributions from the s-process are expected; [(Y,
La, and Ba)/Eu] all rise as expected, and yet [Ba/Y] is still much
higher in the dSph stars than similar metallicity Galactic stars. This
result is consistent with s-process contributions from lower metallicity
AGB stars in dSph galaxies, and is in good agreement with the slower
chemical evolution expected in the low-mass dSph galaxies relative to
the Galaxy, such that the build-up of metals occurs over much longer
timescales. Future investigations of nucleosynthetic constraints (as
well as galaxy formation and evolution) will require an examination of
many stars within individual dwarf galaxies.

Finally, the Na-Ni trend reported in 1997 by Nissen {\amp} Schuster is
confirmed in Galactic halo stars, but we discuss this in terms of the
general nucleosynthesis of neutron-rich elements. We do not confirm that
the Na-Ni trend is related to the accretion of dSph galaxies in the
Galactic halo.

	Abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: Precise abundance ratios are determined for 94 dwarf stars
with T$_{eff}$ K, -1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4, and distances D
{\lap} 335 pc. Most of them have halo kinematics, but 16 thick-disk stars
are included. <BR /> Methods: Equivalent widths of atomic lines are
measured from VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectra with resolutions R{\sime} 55
000 and R {\sime} 40 000, respectively. An LTE abundance analysis based
on MARCS models is applied to derive precise differential abundance
ratios of Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni with respect to Fe. <BR />
Results: The halo stars fall into two populations, clearly separated in
[{$\alpha$}/Fe], where {$\alpha$} refers to the average abundance of Mg, Si,
Ca, and Ti. Differences in [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] are also present with a
remarkably clear correlation between these two abundance ratios. <BR />
Conclusions: The {\ldquo}high-{$\alpha$}{\rdquo} stars may be ancient disk or
bulge stars {\ldquo}heated{\rdquo} to halo kinematics by merging satellite
galaxies or they could have formed as the first stars during the
collapse of a proto-Galactic gas cloud. The kinematics of the
{\ldquo}low-{$\alpha$}{\rdquo} stars suggest that they have been accreted
from dwarf galaxies, and that some of them may originate from the
{$\omega$} Cen progenitor galaxy.

	Abstract = {{Model atmosphere analyses of echelle spectra of some fifty nearby F- and
G-type stars are presented. The sample is confined to the main-sequence,
turnoff and subgiant region, regardless of the metal abundance. On the
base of these data, spectroscopic parallaxes are calculated and compared
to the Hipparcos astrometry to explore the reliability of the derived
stellar parameters, notably the surface gravity and metal abundance
scale. The spectroscopic distance scale is found in good agreement with
the Hipparcos parallaxes and is characterized by a 5\% rms uncertainty.
The results suggest a precision in log g of \~{} 0.1 dex, and 0.05-0.10 dex
for the metallicity. There is also reasonable evidence for the
spectroscopic effective temperature scale to be free of systematic
errors; typical uncertainties are assessed to \~{} 80 K. The basic
spectroscopic parameters are supplemented by data for the
microturbulence velocities, the projected rotational velocities, stellar
radii and alpha -enhancement abundances, the latter represented by the
element magnesium. Stellar masses are also given, though many are
probably subject to small adjustments (typically 5\%) in forthcoming
analyses. The well-defined distance correlation is also demonstrated to
be an efficient means for an identification of spectroscopic binaries.
The results are discussed in terms of a spectroscopically established
distance scale, the sites of the stellar populations in the
[Mg/H]-[Fe/Mg] plane, a timescale for the Galactic thin disk, and the
potential of future T$_{eff}$-log g Kiel diagrams for a precise
determination of Galactic globular clusters ages. Based on observations

	Abstract = {{The Milky Way Galaxy has an age of about 13 billion years. Solar-type
stars evolve all the long way to the realm of degenerate objects on
essentially this time-scale. This, as well as the particular advantage
that the Sun offers through reliable differential spectroscopic
analyses, render these stars the ideal tracers for the fossil record of
our parent spiral. Astrophysics is a science that is known to be
notoriously plagued by selection effects. The present work - with a
major focus in this fourth contribution on model atmosphere analyses of
spectroscopic binaries and multiple star systems - aims at a
volume-complete sample of about 300 nearby F-, G-, and K-type stars that
particularly avoids any kinematical or chemical pre-selection from the
outset. It thereby provides an unbiased record of the local stellar
populations - the ancient thick disc and the much younger thin disc. On
this base, the detailed individual scrutiny of the long-lived stars of
both populations unveils the thick disc as a single-burst component with
a local normalization of no less than 20 per cent. This enormous
fraction, combined with its much larger scaleheight, implies a mass for
the thick disc that is comparable to that of the thin disc. On account
of its completely different mass-to-light ratio the thick disc thereby
becomes the dark side of the Milky Way, an ideal major source for
baryonic dark matter. This massive, ancient population consequently
challenges any gradual build-up scenario for our parent spiral. Even
more, on the supposition that the Galaxy is not unusual, the thick disc
- as it emerges from this unbiased spectroscopic work - particularly
challenges the hierarchical cold-dark-matter-dominated formation picture
for spiral galaxies in general.

@article{Fuhrmann2004,
	Abstract = {{High-resolution spectroscopic observations of about 150 nearby stars or
star systems are presented and discussed. The study of these and another
100 objects of the previous papers of this series implies that the
Galaxy became reality 13 or 14 Gyr ago with the implementation of a
massive, rotationally-supported population of thick-disk stars. The very
high star formation rate in that phase gave rise to a rapid metal
enrichment and an expulsion of gas in supernovae-driven Galactic winds,
but was followed by a star formation gap for no less than three billion
years at the Sun's galactocentric distance. In a second phase, then, the
thin disk - our ``familiar Milky Way'' - came on stage. Nowadays it
traces the bright side of the Galaxy, but it is also embedded in a huge
coffin of dead thick-disk stars that account for a large amount of
baryonic dark matter. As opposed to this, cold-dark-matter-dominated
cosmologies that suggest a more gradual hierarchical buildup through
mergers of minor structures, though popular, are a poor description for
the Milky Way Galaxy - and by inference many other spirals as well - if,
as the sample implies, the fossil records of its long-lived stars do not
stick to this paradigm. Apart from this general picture that emerges
with reference to the entire sample stars, a good deal of the present
work is however also concerned with detailed discussions of many
individual objects. Among the most interesting we mention the blue
straggler or merger candidates HD 165401 and HD 137763/HD 137778, the
likely accretion of a giant planet or brown dwarf on 59 Vir in its
recent history, and HD 63433 that proves to be a young solar analog at
$\backslash$tau{\tilde}200 Myr. Likewise, the secondary to HR 4867, formerly
suspected non-single from the Hipparcos astrometry, is directly
detectable in the high-resolution spectroscopic tracings, whereas the
visual binary $\backslash$chi Cet is instead at least triple, and presumably even
quadruple. With respect to the nearby young stars a complete account of
the Ursa Major Association is presented, and we provide as well plain
evidence for another, the ``Hercules-Lyra Association'', the likely
existence of which was only realized in recent years. On account of its
rotation, chemistry, and age we do confirm that the Sun is very typical
among its G-type neighbors; as to its kinematics, it appears however not
unlikely that the Sun's known low peculiar space velocity could indeed
be the cause for the weak paleontological record of mass extinctions and
major impact events on our parent planet during the most recent Galactic
plane passage of the solar system. Although the significance of this
correlation certainly remains a matter of debate for years to come, we
point in this context to the principal importance of the thick disk for
a complete census with respect to the local surface and volume
densities. Other important effects that can be ascribed to this dark
stellar population comprise (i) the observed plateau in the shape of the
luminosity function of the local FGK stars, (ii) a small though
systematic effect on the basic solar motion, (iii) a reassessment of the
term ``asymmetrical drift velocity'' for the remainder (i.e. the thin
disk) of the stellar objects, (iv) its ability to account for the bulk
of the recently discovered high-velocity blue white dwarfs, (v) its
major contribution to the Sun's {\tilde}220 km s$^{-1}$ rotational
velocity around the Galactic center, and (vi) the significant flattening
that it imposes on the Milky Way's rotation curve. Finally we note a
high multiplicity fraction in the small but volume-complete local sample
of stars of this ancient population. This in turn is highly suggestive
for a star formation scenario wherein the few existing single stellar
objects might only arise from either late mergers or the dynamical
ejection of former triple or higher level star systems.

no apparent ``knee'' present indicating a slower star formation history.

	Abstract = {{We present results for a suite of 14 three-dimensional, high-resolution
hydrodynamical simulations of delayed-detonation models of Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) explosions. This model suite comprises the first set
of three-dimensional SN Ia simulations with detailed isotopic yield
information. As such, it may serve as a data base for Chandrasekhar-mass
delayed-detonation model nucleosynthetic yields and for deriving
synthetic observables such as spectra and light curves. We employ a
physically motivated, stochastic model based on turbulent velocity
fluctuations and fuel density to calculate in situ the
deflagration-to-detonation transition probabilities. To obtain different
strengths of the deflagration phase and thereby different degrees of
pre-expansion, we have chosen a sequence of initial models with 1, 3, 5,
10, 20, 40, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 1600 (two different realizations)
ignition kernels in a hydrostatic white dwarf with a central density of
2.9 {\times} 10$^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$, as well as one high
central density (5.5 {\times} 10$^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$) and one
low central density (1.0 {\times} 10$^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$)
rendition of the 100 ignition kernel configuration. For each simulation,
we determined detailed nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing
10$^{6}$ tracer particles with a 384 nuclide reaction network. All
delayed-detonation models result in explosions unbinding the white
dwarf, producing a range of $^{56}$Ni masses from 0.32 to 1.11
M$_{&sun;}$. As a general trend, the models predict that the
stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes are not found at the lowest
velocities, but rather at intermediate velocities ({\tilde}3000-10 000 km
s$^{-1}$) in a shell surrounding a $^{56}$Ni-rich core. The
models further predict relatively low-velocity oxygen and carbon, with
typical minimum velocities around 4000 and 10 000 km s$^{-1}$,
respectively.

	Abstract = {{Using the DR12 public release of APOGEE data, we show that the thin and
thick discs separate very well in the space defined by [{$\alpha$}/Fe],
[Fe/H] and [C/N]. Thick disc giants have both higher [C/N] and higher
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] than do thin disc stars with similar [Fe/H]. We deduce that
the thick disc is composed of lower mass stars than the thin disc.
Considering the fact that at a given metallicity there is a one-to-one
relation between stellar mass and age, we are then able to infer the
chronology of disc formation. Both the thick and the thin discs -
defined by [{$\alpha$}/Fe] - converge in their dependence on [C/N] and
[C+N/Fe] at [Fe/H]{\ap}-0.7. We conclude that (1) the majority of thick
disc stars formed earlier than did the thin disc stars, (2) the
formation histories of the thin and thick discs diverged early on, even
when the [Fe/H] abundances are similar and (3) that the star formation
rate in the thin disc has been lower than in the thick disc, at all
metallicities. Although these general conclusions remain robust, we also
show that current stellar evolution models cannot reproduce the observed
C/N ratios for thick disc stars. Unexpectedly, reduced or inhibited
canonical extra mixing is very common in field stars. While subject to
abundance calibration zero-point uncertainties, this implies a strong
dependence of non-canonical extra mixing along the red giant branch on
the initial composition of the star and in particular on the
{$\alpha$}-elemental abundance.

	Abstract = {{New spectroscopic surveys offer the promise of stellar parameters and
abundances ({\ldquo}stellar labels{\rdquo}) for hundreds of thousands of
stars; this poses a formidable spectral modeling challenge. In many
cases, there is a subset of reference objects for which the stellar
labels are known with high(er) fidelity. We take advantage of this with
The Cannon, a new data-driven approach for determining stellar labels
from spectroscopic data. The Cannon learns from the {\ldquo}known{\rdquo}
labels of reference stars how the continuum-normalized spectra depend on
these labels by fitting a flexible model at each wavelength; then, The
Cannon uses this model to derive labels for the remaining survey stars.
We illustrate The Cannon by training the model on only 542 stars in 19
clusters as reference objects, with $\{$T$\}$$_{{eff}$$\}$, $\{$log$\}$ g, and
[$\{$Fe$\}$/$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$] as the labels, and then applying it to the spectra of
55,000 stars from APOGEE DR10. The Cannon is very accurate. Its stellar
labels compare well to the stars for which APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP)
labels are provided in DR10, with rms differences that are basically
identical to the stated ASPCAP uncertainties. Beyond the reference
labels, The Cannon makes no use of stellar models nor any line-list, but
needs a set of reference objects that span label-space. The Cannon
performs well at lower signal-to-noise, as it delivers comparably good
labels even at one-ninth the APOGEE observing time. We discuss the
limitations of The Cannon and its future potential, particularly, to
bring different spectroscopic surveys onto a consistent scale of stellar
labels.

	Abstract = {{We present the data reduction procedures being used by the GALactic
Archeology with Hermes (GALAH) survey, carried out with the HERMES
fibre-fed, multi-object spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian
Telescope. GALAH is a unique survey, targeting 1 million stars brighter
than magnitude V = 14 at a resolution of 28 000 with a goal to measure
the abundances of 29 elements. Such a large number of high-resolution
spectra necessitate the development of a reduction pipeline optimized
for speed, accuracy, and consistency. We outline the design and
structure of the IRAF-based reduction pipeline that we developed,
specifically for GALAH, to produce fully calibrated spectra aimed for
subsequent stellar atmospheric parameter estimation. The pipeline takes
advantage of existing IRAF routines and other readily available software
so as to be simple to maintain, testable, and reliable. A radial
velocity and stellar atmospheric parameter estimator code is also
presented, which is used for further data analysis and yields a useful
verification of the reduction quality. We have used this estimator to
quantify the data quality of GALAH for fibre cross-talk level ({\lsim}0.5
per cent) and scattered light ({\tilde}5 counts in a typical 20 min
exposure), resolution across the field, sky spectrum properties,
wavelength solution reliability (better than 1 km s$^{-1}$
accuracy), and radial velocity precision.

	Abstract = {{Context. Elements heavier than Li are produced in the interiors of
stars. However, for many elements the exact production sites and the
timescales on which they are dispersed into the interstellar medium are
unknown. Having a clear picture on the origins of the elements is
important for our ability to trace and understand the formation and
chemical evolution of the Milky Way and its stellar populations. <BR />
Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the origin and evolution
of Sc, V, Mn, and Co for a homogeneous and statistically significant
sample of stars probing the different populations of the Milky Way, in
particular the thin and thick disks. <BR /> Methods: Using
high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE, FEROS, SOFIN, FIES,
UVES, and HARPS spectrographs, we determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co abundances
for a large sample of F and G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. The
method is based on spectral synthesis and using one-dimensional,
plane-parallel, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model stellar
atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. The non-LTE (NLTE)
corrections from the literature were applied to Mn and Co. <BR />
Results: We find that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V
(466 stars), and Co (567 stars) are very similar to what has been
observed for the {$\alpha$}-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the
contrary, Mn (569 stars) is generally underabundant relative to the Sun
(i.e., [ Mn/Fe ] $\lt$ 0) for [ Fe/H ] $\lt$ 0. In addition, for Mn, when
NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is almost flat over
the entire metallicity range of the stars in our sample (-2 {\lsim} [
Fe/H ] {\lsim} + 0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small
separation between the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they
completely overlap. For Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe], but
only when NLTE corrections are used. Comparisons with Ti as a reference
element show flat trends for all the elements except for Mn that show
well separated [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for the thin and thick disks. <BR
/> Conclusions: The elements Sc and V present trends compatible with
production from type II supernovae (SNII) events. In addition, Sc
clearly shows a metallicity dependence for [ Fe/H ] $\lt$ -1. Instead, Mn
is produced in SNII events for [ Fe/H ] {\lsim} -0.4 and then type Ia
supernovae start to produce Mn. Finally, Co appears to be produced
mainly in SNII with suggestion of enrichment from hypernovae at low
metallicities.

@article{Battistini2016,
	Abstract = {{Context. Elements heavier than iron are produced through neutron-capture
processes in the different phases of stellar evolution. Asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars are believed to be mainly responsible for elements
that form through the slow neutron-capture process, while the elements
created in the rapid neutron-capture process have production sites that
are less understood. Knowledge of abundance ratios as functions of
metallicity can lead to insight into the origin and evolution of our
Galaxy and its stellar populations. <BR /> Aims: We aim to trace the
chemical evolution of the neutron-capture elements Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Nd,
Sm, and Eu in the Milky Way stellar disk. This will allow us to
constrain the formation sites of these elements, as well as to probe the
evolution of the Galactic thin and thick disks. <BR /> Methods: Using
spectra of high resolution (42 000 {\lsim} R {\lsim} 65 000) and high
signal-to-noise (S/N {\gsim} 200) obtained with the MIKE and the FEROS
spectrographs, we determine Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu abundances
for a sample of 593 F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood. The
abundance analysis is based on spectral synthesis using one-dimensional,
plane-parallel, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model stellar
atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. <BR /> Results: We
present abundance results for Sr (156 stars), Zr (311 stars), La (242
stars), Ce (365 stars), Nd (395 stars), Sm (280 stars), and Eu (378
stars). We find that Nd, Sm, and Eu show trends similar to what is
observed for the {$\alpha$} elements in the [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance plane.
For [Sr/Fe] and [Zr/Fe], we find decreasing abundance ratios for
increasing metallicity, reaching sub-solar values at super-solar
metallicities. [La/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] do not show any clear trend with
metallicity, and they are close to solar values at all [Fe/H]. The
trends of abundance ratios [X/Fe] as a function of stellar ages present
different slopes before and after 8 Gyr. <BR /> Conclusions: The rapid
neutron-capture process is active early in the Galaxy, mainly in type-II
supernovae from stars in the mass range 8-10 M$_{&sun;}$. Europium
is almost completely produced by the r-process, but Nd and Sm show
similar trends to Eu even if their s-process component is higher.
Strontium and Zr are thought to be mainly produced by the s-process, but
show significant enrichment at low metallicity that requires extra
r-process production, which probably is different from the classical
r-process. Finally, La and Ce are mainly produced via s-process from AGB
stars in the mass range 2-4 M$_{&sun;}$, which can be seen by the
decrease in [La/Eu] and [Ce/Eu] at [Fe/H] {\ap} -0.5. The trend of [X/Fe]
with age could be explained by considering that the decrease in [X/Fe]
for the thick disk stars can be due to the decrease in type-II
supernovae with time, meaning a reduced enrichment of r-process elements
in the interstellar medium. In the thin disk, the trends are flatter,
which is probably due to the main production from the s-process being
balanced by Fe production from type-Ia supernovae.

	Abstract = {{Galah is an ongoing high-resolution spectroscopic survey with the goal
of disentangling the formation history of the Milky Way using the fossil
remnants of disrupted star formation sites that are now dispersed around
the Galaxy. It is targeting a randomly selected magnitude-limited (V
{\le} 14) sample of stars, with the goal of observing one million
objects. To date, 300,000 spectra have been obtained. Not all of them
are correctly processed by parameter estimation pipelines, and we need
to know about them. We present a semi-automated classification scheme
that identifies different types of peculiar spectral morphologies in an
effort to discover and flag potentially problematic spectra and thus
help to preserve the integrity of the survey results. To this end, we
employ the recently developed dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE
(t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), which enables us to
represent the complex spectral morphology in a two-dimensional
projection map while still preserving the properties of the local
neighborhoods of spectra. We find that the majority (178,483) of the
209,533 Galah spectra considered in this study represents normal single
stars, whereas 31,050 peculiar and problematic spectra with very diverse
spectral features pertaining to 28,579 stars are distributed into 10
classification categories: hot stars, cool metal-poor giants, molecular
absorption bands, binary stars, H{$\alpha$}/H{$\beta$} emission,
H{$\alpha$}/H{$\beta$} emission superimposed on absorption, H{$\alpha$}/H{$\beta$}
P-Cygni, H{$\alpha$}/H{$\beta$} inverted P-Cygni, lithium absorption, and
problematic. Classified spectra with supplementary information are
presented in the catalog, indicating candidates for follow-up
observations and population studies of the short-lived phases of stellar
evolution.

	Abstract = {{Context. In the current era of large spectroscopic surveys of the Milky
Way, reference stars for calibrating astrophysical parameters and
chemical abundances are of paramount importance. <BR /> Aims: We
determine elemental abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, and
Ni for our predefined set of Gaia FGK benchmark stars. <BR /> Methods:
By analysing high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio
taken from several archive datasets, we combined results of eight
different methods to determine abundances on a line-by-line basis. We
performed a detailed homogeneous analysis of the systematic
uncertainties, such as differential versus absolute abundance analysis.
We also assessed errors that are due to non-local thermal equilibrium
and the stellar parameters in our final abundances. <BR /> Results: Our
results are provided by listing final abundances and the different
sources of uncertainties, as well as line-by-line and method-by-method
abundances. <BR /> Conclusions: The atmospheric parameters of the Gaia
FGK benchmark stars are already being widely used for calibration of
several pipelines that are applied to different surveys. With the added
reference abundances of ten elements, this set is very suitable for
calibrating the chemical abundances obtained by these pipelines.

@article{Fuhrmann2011,
	Abstract = {{This fifth in a series of papers finishes the model atmosphere analyses
of an unbiased, volume-complete sample of more than 300 nearby
solar-type stars. The sample first disintegrates into thick-disc and
thin-disc stars on account of their different distributions in the
[Mg/H]-[Fe/Mg] chemical abundance plane. Detailed stellar age-datings of
the locally few, but very relevant, subgiants show this map to be the
sequel of a major star formation gap and hence the legacy for the two
stellar populations. Among the stars of the thin disc the subgiant 70
Vir with {$\tau$}= 8.1 {\plusmn} 0.6 Gyr remains the best case to constrain
the age of this comparatively young population. Uncertainties for the
existing thick-disc subgiants are about twice as much, but they
consistently promote ages of 12-13 Gyr. The unbiased thin-disc
metallicity distribution functions of magnesium and iron average at
$\lt$[Mg/H]$\gt$=-0.009 {\plusmn} 0.012 dex and $\lt$[Fe/H]$\gt$=-0.034
{\plusmn} 0.015 dex, thereby demonstrating that the Sun is a typical
thin-disc star in terms of these two elements. The small but likewise
unbiased sample of thick-disc stars leads to $\lt$[Mg/H]$\gt$=-0.207
{\plusmn} 0.049 dex and $\lt$[Fe/H]$\gt$=-0.584 {\plusmn} 0.057 dex, which
implies that about two-thirds of the {$\alpha$}-element magnesium was
already synthesized in the early Milky Way. Similarly, the
age-metallicity relations for the thin disc result in
{$\Delta$}[Mg/H]=+0.006 dex Gyr$^{-1}$ and {$\Delta$}[Fe/H]=+0.017 dex
Gyr$^{-1}$ and lead to the conclusion that a similar percentage of
iron was synthesized before the birth of the thin disc. In comparison
with the considerable metallicity dispersions {$\sigma$}$_{[Mg/H]}$=
0.151 dex and {$\sigma$}$_{[Fe/H]}$= 0.191 dex for the stars of the
thin disc, this immediately explains the coexistence of old, metal rich
as well as young, fairly metal poor stars within this stellar
population. The stellar multiplicities of the solar-type thin-disc stars
show a minority of less than 47 per cent to be single and at least 15
per cent to belong to triple and higher level systems. More concisely,
in terms of the primary masses there is a clear correlation with mass
with a cross-over of preferentially single to binary stars at M{\sime}
1.25 M$_{&sun;}$ and a fraction of 21 per cent of triple and
higher level systems at this particular mass. The steady record of new
discoveries of nearby companion stars renders these numbers, however, as
yet provisional, with an ever-decreasing fraction of single objects. For
the thick disc the multiplicity statistics are necessarily weak, yet
tentatively imply even less single stars and eventually more triple or
higher level systems. Most importantly, and as already addressed in the
previous papers of this series, the rigorous census of the long-lived
stars of the sample uncovers the thick disc as a massive, dark
population with a 20 per cent local normalization, and, on account of
its larger scaleheight, a mass comparable to that of the thin disc. With
the ages of its stars at or above 12 Gyr the thick-disc epoch then leads
to a very different star formation rate and qualifies this stellar
population as a single-burst component, much at variance with the thin
disc whose stars cover the complete stellar age range of 1 Myr up to 8
Gyr. Such information conveyed by the stars of the solar neighbourhood
then clearly do not support a gradual build-up scenario, a hierarchical
cold-dark-matter-dominated formation picture for our parent spiral.
Provided the Milky Way is not an unusual spiral galaxy, it implies that
this paradigm is also challenged in a much broader context.

galaxies. It is the only galaxy whose formation history can be studied

(L$_{*}$) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a
dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties,
it falls in the sparsely populated {\ldquo}green valley{\rdquo} region of
the galaxy color-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated,
structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to
uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic
studies will continue to play a fundamental role far into the future
because there are measurements that can only be made in the near field

@article{Haywood2013,
	Abstract = {{We analyze a sample of solar neighborhood stars that have high-quality
abundance determinations and show that there are two distinct regimes of
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus age, which we identify as the epochs of the thick
and thin disk formation. A tight correlation between metallicity and
[{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus age is clearly identifiable for thick disk stars,
implying that this population formed from a well mixed interstellar
medium, probably initially in starburst and then more quiescently, over
a time scale of 4-5 Gyr. Thick disk stars have vertical velocity
dispersions which correlate with age, with the youngest objects of this
population having small scale heights similar to those of thin disk
stars. A natural consequence of these two results is that a vertical
metallicity gradient is expected in this population. We suggest that the
youngest thick disk set the initial conditions from which the inner thin
disk started to form about 8 Gyr ago, at [Fe/H] in the range of (-0.1,
+0.1) dex and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] \~{} 0.1 dex. This also provides an explanation
for the apparent coincidence between the existence of a step in
metallicity at 7-10 kpc in the thin disk and the confinement of the
thick disk within R $\lt$ 10 kpc. We suggest that the outer thin disk
developed outside the influence of the thick disk, giving rise to a
separate structure, but also that the high alpha-enrichment of those
regions may originate from a primordial pollution of the outer regions
by the gas expelled from the forming thick disk. Metal-poor thin disk
stars ([Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4 dex) in the solar vicinity, whose properties are
best explained by them originating in the outer disk, are shown to be as
old as the youngest thick disk (9-10 Gyr). This implies that the outer
thin disk started to form while the thick disk was still forming stars
in the inner parts of the Galaxy. Hence, while the overall inner
(thick+thin) disk is comprised of two structures with different scale
lengths and whose combination may give the impression of an inside-out
formation process, the thin disk itself probably formed its first stars
in its outskirts. Moreover, we point out that, given the tight
age-metallicity and age-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] relations that exist in the thick
disk, an inside-out process would give rise to a radial gradient in
metallicity and {$\alpha$}-elements in this population, which is not
observed. Finally, we argue that our results leave little room for
radial migration (in the sense of churning) either to have contaminated
the solar vicinity, or, on a larger scale, to have redistributed stars
in significant proportion across the solar annulus.

	Abstract = {{Context. We performed a uniform and detailed abundance analysis of 12
refractory elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Co, Sc, Mn, and V)
for a sample of 1111 FGK dwarf stars from the HARPS GTO planet search
program. Of these stars, 109 are known to harbor giant planetary
companions and 26 stars are exclusively hosting Neptunians and
super-Earths. <BR /> Aims: The two main goals of this paper are to
investigate whether there are any differences between the elemental
abundance trends for stars of different stellar populations and to
characterize the planet host and non-host samples in terms of their
[X/H]. The extensive study of this sample, focused on the abundance
differences between stars with and without planets will be presented in
a parallel paper. <BR /> Methods: The equivalent widths of spectral
lines were automatically measured from HARPS spectra with the ARES code.
The abundances of the chemical elements were determined using an LTE
abundance analysis relative to the Sun, with the 2010 revised version of
the spectral synthesis code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9
atmospheres. To separate the Galactic stellar populations we applied
both a purely kinematical approach and a chemical method. <BR />
Results: We found that the chemically separated (based on the Mg, Si,
and Ti abundances) thin- and thick disks are also chemically disjunct
for Al, Sc, Co, and Ca. Some bifurcation might also exist for Na, V, Ni,
and Mn, but there is no clear boundary of their [X/Fe] ratios. We
confirm that an overabundance in giant-planet host stars is clear for
all studied elements.We also confirm that stars hosting only
Neptunian-like planets may be easier to detect around stars with similar
metallicities than around non-planet hosts, although for some elements
(particulary {$\alpha$}-elements) the lower limit of [X/H] is very abrupt.

	Abstract = {{We develop a chemical evolution model to study the star formation
history of the Milky Way. Our model assumes that the Milky Way has
formed from a closed-box-like system in the inner regions, while the
outer parts of the disc have experienced some accretion. Unlike the
usual procedure, we do not fix the star formation prescription (e.g.
Kennicutt law) to reproduce the chemical abundance trends. Instead, we
fit the abundance trends with age to recover the star formation history
of the Galaxy. Our method enables us to recover the star formation
history of the Milky Way in the first Gyrs with unprecedented accuracy
in the inner (R $\lt$ 7-8 kpc) and outer (R $\gt$ 9-10 kpc) discs, as
sampled in the solar vicinity. We show that half the stellar mass formed
during the thick-disc phase in the inner galaxy during the first 4-5
Gyr. This phase was followed by a significant dip in star formation
activity (at 8-9 Gyr) and a period of roughly constant lower-level star
formation for the remaining 8 Gyr. The thick-disc phase has produced as
many metals in 4 Gyr as the thin-disc phase in the remaining 8 Gyr. Our
results suggest that a closed-box model is able to fit all the available
constraints in the inner disc. A closed-box system is qualitatively
equivalent to a regime where the accretion rate maintains a high gas
fraction in the inner disc at high redshift. In these conditions the SFR
is mainly governed by the high turbulence of the interstellar medium. By
z \~{} 1 it is possible that most of the accretion takes place in the outer
disc, while the star formation activity in the inner disc is mostly
sustained by the gas that is not consumed during the thick-disc phase
and the continuous ejecta from earlier generations of stars. The outer
disc follows a star formation history very similar to that of the inner
disc, although initiated at z \~{} 2, about 2 Gyr before the onset of the
thin-disc formation in the inner disc.

Release 12, we measure the distribution of stars in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]
versus [Fe/H] plane and the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs)
across an unprecedented volume of the Milky Way disk, with radius 3 $\lt$
R $\lt$ 15 kpc and height | z| $\backslash$lt 2 kpc. Stars in the inner disk (R $\lt$
5 kpc) lie along a single track in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H], starting
with {$\alpha$}-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at [{$\alpha$}/Fe] {\tilde}
0 and [Fe/H] {\tilde} +0.4. At larger radii we find two distinct sequences
in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H] space, with a roughly solar-{$\alpha$}
sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-{$\alpha$} sequence
that merges with the low-{$\alpha$} sequence at super-solar [Fe/H]. The
location of the high-{$\alpha$} sequence is nearly constant across the disk
however, there are very few high-{$\alpha$} stars at R $\gt$ 11 kpc. The
peak of the midplane MDF shifts to lower metallicity at larger R,
reflecting the Galactic metallicity gradient. Most strikingly, the shape
of the midplane MDF changes systematically with radius, from a
negatively skewed distribution at 3 $\lt$ R $\lt$ 7 kpc, to a roughly
Gaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape
in the outer Galaxy. For stars with | z| $\backslash$gt 1 kpc or [{$\alpha$}/Fe] $\gt$
0.18, the MDF shows little dependence on R. The positive skewness of the
outer-disk MDF may be a signature of radial migration; we show that
blurring of stellar populations by orbital eccentricities is not enough
to explain the reversal of MDF shape, but a simple model of radial
migration can do so.
